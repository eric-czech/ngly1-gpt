Abstract
Purpose: The endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway is responsible for the translocation of misfolded proteins across the ER membrane into the cytosol for subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In order to understand the spectrum of clinical and molecular findings in a complex neurological syndrome, we studied a series of eight patients with inherited deficiency of N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1), a novel disorder of cytosolic ERAD dysfunction.
 Methods: Whole-genome, whole-exome or standard Sanger sequencing techniques were employed. Retrospective chart reviews were performed in order to obtain clinical data.
 Results: All patients had global developmental delay, a movement disorder, and hypotonia. Other common findings included hypo- or alacrima (7/8), elevated liver transaminases (6/7), microcephaly (6/8), diminished reflexes (6/8), hepatocyte cytoplasmic storage material or vacuolization (5/6), and seizures (4/8). The nonsense mutation c.1201A>T (p.R401X) was the most common deleterious allele.
 Conclusions: NGLY1 deficiency is a novel autosomal recessive disorder of the ERAD pathway associated with neurological dysfunction, abnormal tear production, and liver disease. The majority of patients detected to date carry a specific nonsense mutation that appears to be associated with severe disease. The phenotypic spectrum is likely to enlarge as cases with a more broad range of mutations are detected.

INTRODUCTION
 The enzyme N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1), also known as peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase, EC 3.5.1.52), catalyzes protein deglycosylation by cleaving the -aspartyl glycosylamine bond of N-linked glycoproteins with the subsequent release of intact N-glycan species [1]. NGLY1 activity was first described in almond seeds [1], but is ubiquitously present across a wide range of species, including bacteria [2], yeast [3â€“5], amoeba [6], fish [7], and mammals [8,9]. Evidence suggests that NGLY1 participates as a key cytoplasmic component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery along with the AAA ATPase complex p97 [10,11]. The ERAD pathway is a mechanism for identifying and degrading misfolded glycoproteins. N-glycans that are high in mannose content act as quality control tags for proteins in the early stages of the secretory pathway [12,13]. Misfolded glycoproteins are detected by ER luminal lectins and are then translocated to the cytosol via the ERAD machinery, to be subsequently degraded by cytosolic enzymes including NGLY1 [14].
 To date, a single patient with NGLY1 deficiency has been reported as part of a whole-exome sequencing (WES) study focusing on the utility of this technology to detect the underlying genetic etiology of disorders affecting patients with previously undiagnosed or unresolved genetic conditions [15]. Need et al. described a 3-year-old boy with compound heterozygous inactivating mutations in NGLY1 and suggested that this could be a new disorder. The initial patient had a clinical phenotype suggestive of a congenital disorder of glycosylation, although repeated transferrin isoelectric focusing and N-glycan analyses were normal. Liver biopsy showed accumulation of an amorphous unidentified substance throughout the cytoplasm, a finding likely consistent with NGLY1 dysfunction, which would be expected to result in abnormal accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins because of impaired cytosolic degradation [15]. We now report clinical and molecular findings present in seven newly diagnosed patients with mutations in NGLY1, and further details related to the original case. These observations confirm NGLY1 deficiency as an inherited disorder associated with the ERAD process and document its clinical presentation.
