Abstract
Purpose: The endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway is responsible for the translocation of misfolded proteins across the ER membrane into the cytosol for subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In order to understand the spectrum of clinical and molecular findings in a complex neurological syndrome, we studied a series of eight patients with inherited deficiency of N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1), a novel disorder of cytosolic ERAD dysfunction.
 Methods: Whole-genome, whole-exome or standard Sanger sequencing techniques were employed. Retrospective chart reviews were performed in order to obtain clinical data.
 Results: All patients had global developmental delay, a movement disorder, and hypotonia. Other common findings included hypo- or alacrima (7/8), elevated liver transaminases (6/7), microcephaly (6/8), diminished reflexes (6/8), hepatocyte cytoplasmic storage material or vacuolization (5/6), and seizures (4/8). The nonsense mutation c.1201A>T (p.R401X) was the most common deleterious allele.
 Conclusions: NGLY1 deficiency is a novel autosomal recessive disorder of the ERAD pathway associated with neurological dysfunction, abnormal tear production, and liver disease. The majority of patients detected to date carry a specific nonsense mutation that appears to be associated with severe disease. The phenotypic spectrum is likely to enlarge as cases with a more broad range of mutations are detected.

INTRODUCTION
 The enzyme N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1), also known as peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase, EC 3.5.1.52), catalyzes protein deglycosylation by cleaving the -aspartyl glycosylamine bond of N-linked glycoproteins with the subsequent release of intact N-glycan species [1]. NGLY1 activity was first described in almond seeds [1], but is ubiquitously present across a wide range of species, including bacteria [2], yeast [3–5], amoeba [6], fish [7], and mammals [8,9]. Evidence suggests that NGLY1 participates as a key cytoplasmic component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery along with the AAA ATPase complex p97 [10,11]. The ERAD pathway is a mechanism for identifying and degrading misfolded glycoproteins. N-glycans that are high in mannose content act as quality control tags for proteins in the early stages of the secretory pathway [12,13]. Misfolded glycoproteins are detected by ER luminal lectins and are then translocated to the cytosol via the ERAD machinery, to be subsequently degraded by cytosolic enzymes including NGLY1 [14].

--- BEGIN TEXT ---
To date, a single patient with NGLY1 deficiency has been reported as part of a whole-exome sequencing (WES) study focusing on the utility of this technology to detect the underlying genetic etiology of disorders affecting patients with previously undiagnosed or unresolved genetic conditions [15]. Need et al. described a 3-year-old boy with compound heterozygous inactivating mutations in NGLY1 and suggested that this could be a new disorder. The initial patient had a clinical phenotype suggestive of a congenital disorder of glycosylation, although repeated transferrin isoelectric focusing and N-glycan analyses were normal. Liver biopsy showed accumulation of an amorphous unidentified substance throughout the cytoplasm, a finding likely consistent with NGLY1 dysfunction, which would be expected to result in abnormal accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins because of impaired cytosolic degradation [15]. We now report clinical and molecular findings present in seven newly diagnosed patients with mutations in NGLY1, and further details related to the original case. These observations confirm NGLY1 deficiency as an inherited disorder associated with the ERAD process and document its clinical presentation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Stanford Institutional Review Board approved this study. Clinical data were abstracted from the medical records by retrospective chart review. Further data were collected by direct interaction with the families of participating subjects. Exome sequencing was performed in Patient 1 (Duke University), Patients 5 and 6 (University of British Columbia) and parents using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform and the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon 50 Mb Kit. For Patient 3 (Stanford University), the patient and parents were sequenced using both Illumina HiSeq2000 and Complete Genomics platforms. Variants in Illumina-sequenced reads were called using both the Hugeseq and Real Time Genomics pipelines and Complete Genomics variants were identified by their own variant callers. For Patient 3 (Baylor College of Medicine) DNA was capture- sequenced using a commercially developed capture reagent (VCRome2). Sequence data were generated on an Illumina HiSeq2000 producing an average coverage of 80× with >90% of targeted bases at 20× coverage or higher. WES was performed on a clinical basis in three patients (Patient 2 [Baylor College of Medicine Whole Genome Laboratory, Houston, Texas], and Patients 6 and 7 [Emory Genetics Laboratory, Atlanta, Georgia]). Sanger sequencing of NGLY1 was performed in Patient 4 at Duke University and results were confirmed by a clinical laboratory (GeneDx, Gaithersburg, Maryland).

RESULTS
Case reports
The clinical and molecular findings demonstrate clear clinical similarities of patients with NYGL1 deficiency, although some variation in overall severity was observed, with the most common mutation being associated with more severe outcomes (Table 1 and Figure 1). All patients had global developmental delay, a movement disorder, and hypotonia. Other common findings included hypo- or alacrima (7/8), abnormal brain imaging (7/8), EEG abnormalities (7/8), elevated liver transaminases (6/7), microcephaly (6/8), diminished reflexes (6/8), hepatocyte cytoplasmic storage material or vacuolization (5/6), seizures (4/8), and abnormal nerve conduction (3/3). Two of the patients died prematurely at 9 months and 5 years of age. Pedigrees for all patients are shown in Figure 2. Short clinical summaries are provided below. Further details may be found in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Patient 2, a now 20-year-old female, was born at 39 weeks of gestation via Cesarean section because of intrauterine growth retardation and an abnormal appearing placenta. At four months of age, hypotonia, developmental delay and elevated liver transaminases were noted. At approximately 4 years of age, a slight intention tremor and frequent involuntary movements of her neck, hands and arm were observed. At 5 years of age, she was noted to have ocular apraxia, distal tapering of hands and feet, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. She has cortical vision impairment, as well as alacrima and dry eyes that require lubrication, but has not developed corneal scarring. Presently, she has marked intellectual disabilities and requires total care. She has very little expressive speech and communicates through an electronic speech-generating device.

Patient 3, a now 4-year-old girl, was born via Cesarean section at term for a non-reassuring fetal heart tracing and was monitored in the NICU because of poor feeding and lethargy. The pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester screen noting increased risk for Smith-Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and trisomy 18 (AFP 1.63 MoM, uE3 0.26 MoM, hCG 0.54 MoM, inhibin 1.02 MoM), but karyotype on amniocentesis was normal. As a neonate, she had hyperbilirubinemia that was treated with phototherapy and was noted to have elevated liver transaminases and transient thrombocytopenia. In infancy, she was noted to have global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, bilateral exotropia, hypotonia, constipation, and intermittent mild lactic acidemia (3.7 to 7.5 mM, normal <3). At approximately age 1 year, the parents noticed that she did not make tears when crying, although she had adequate tear production to keep her eyes moist. She has had intermittent chalazions, but no corneal scarring. She also developed staring spells, lasting up to 15 seconds, at approximately age 1 year; these episodes occur about once daily and can be interrupted by gentle contact. By age 17 months she had developed an extrapyramidal movement disorder consisting of asynchronous myoclonic jerks of the limbs and shoulders and subtle choreoathetotic movements of the hands and fingers. At 4 years she can ambulate unassisted, although her gait is unsteady, and communicates with vocalizations, gestures and use of a speech-generating device.

Patient 4, a now 2-year-old boy, was delivered by Cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation after fetal distress was noted on cardiotocography. Pregnancy history was positive for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and oligohydramnios. He had mild hyperbilirubinemia, but otherwise his neonatal course was unremarkable and he was discharged on day of life three. Intermittent head flexion was noted at 6 months, and an EEG at 8 months showed generalized poly-spike discharges. Soon thereafter, mild tonic seizures with head and body flexion started, and evolved to single, symmetric spasms with bilateral arm extension. Involuntary movements of the upper extremities were also noted at this time. In addition, global developmental delay, bilateral ptosis, abnormal tear production, elevated liver transaminases (3 to 4 times upper limit of normal), and constipation were noted in infancy. He has had recurrent episodes of keratoconjunctivitis and poor lid closure during sleep with resultant corneal scarring.

Patient 5, a boy who died at the age of 5 years, was born at term following a pregnancy that was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screening for trisomy 18 and Smith- Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) (AFP 1.97 MoM, uE3 0.24 MoM and hCG 0.48 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal male karyotype and measurement of 7-dehydrocholesterol in amniotic fluid excluded SLOS. Because of concerns for IUGR and a non-reassuring stress test, he was delivered by Cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation. He was noted to have mild flexion contractures of both knees, but had an uneventful neonatal period. He had global developmental delay and constant movements of his arms and legs since early infancy and developed head bobbing at 7 months. At 8 months, liver transaminase elevations (approximately 1.5 times the upper limit of normal) were noted, and the elevations persisted until age 3 1⁄2 years. Although his reflexes appeared normal in infancy, they were diminished by age 2 years and at 38 months could no longer be elicited. During the second year of life, he was noted to have dry eyes that were treated with lubricant drops at bedtime, and microcephaly was present by 16 months. At 2 1⁄2 years, he developed myoclonic seizures that became intractable despite numerous therapeutic trials. Between the ages of 10 months and five years, he showed slow developmental progress, but regressed during the last year. He died at age 5 years following a viral illness and a prolonged seizure.

Patient 6 is the younger sister of Subject 5. The pregnancy was also complicated by a positive second trimester serum screen for trisomy 18 and SLOS (AFP 0.87 MoM, uE3 0.31 MoM, hCG 0.57 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal female karyotype. She was delivered by Cesarean section at 35 weeks of gestation following an ultrasound that was concerning for IUGR. She had jaundice requiring phototherapy, but her course in the nursery was otherwise uneventful. By age 9 months, developmental delay was apparent and she had developed hypotonia, microcephaly, a mildly myopathic- appearing face and constant involuntary movements with a tendency to hyperextend her arms and close her fists. At 9 1⁄2 months of age, she died unexpectedly in her sleep and the cause of death remains unknown.

Patient 6|NA|Younger sister of Subject 5. Pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screen for trisomy 18 and SLOS (AFP 0.87 MoM, uE3 0.31 MoM, hCG 0.57 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal female karyotype. Delivered by Cesarean section at 35 weeks of gestation following an ultrasound that was concerning for IUGR. Had jaundice requiring phototherapy, but her course in the nursery was otherwise uneventful. By age 9 months, developmental delay was apparent and she had developed hypotonia, microcephaly, a mildly myopathic- appearing face and constant involuntary movements with a tendency to hyperextend her arms and close her fists. At 9 1⁄2 months of age, she died unexpectedly in her sleep and the cause of death remains unknown.

Patient 7, a now 3-year-old girl, was born at term via scheduled Cesarean section and, other than mild jaundice, did not have any neonatal complications. Prenatal screen showed an increased risk for trisomy 21. In infancy, she was noted to have strabismus, hypotonia, athetoid arm and hand movements, clasped hands, and elevated liver transaminases (approximately 3 times upper limit of normal). Microcephaly was present by age 2 years. In addition, severe developmental delay was present, but she has shown slow progress without regression. She learned to sit alone and started to crawl at 2 years, but had no words.

Patient 8, a now 16-year-old girl, is the older sister of Subject 7. She was born at term via Cesarean section for decreased fetal movement and bradycardia. Prenatal history was significant for IUGR. She had cyanosis at birth and required resuscitation. Anal stenosis requiring dilatation was noted in the first week of life, but she did not have further neonatal problems and was discharged home on day of life 7. She was noted to have hypotonia, a movement disorder consisting of head bobbing and extremity athetosis, and developmental delay in early infancy. At 3 years, she could stand unsupported, ambulate with a walker, and started to babble. Seizures developed at age 11 years and she lost all mobility. Other medical history includes acquired microcephaly, an inability to close her eyes completely during sleep, chronic conjunctivitis, corneal clouding, hypolacrima, strabismus, hearing impairment, gastro-esophageal reflux, chronic constipation, severe scoliosis and talipes equinovarus.

DISCUSSION
 The finding of compound heterozygous knockout mutations in NGLY1 in the original case suggested that NGLY1 deficiency (OMIM 615273) represents a new disorder [15]. Soon after the initial report, we were able to identify the seven additional cases reported herein, therefore confirming NGLY1 deficiency as an inherited disorder of the ERAD pathway and the first to be identified that involves the cytosolic proteasome. The rapid ascertainment of cases occurred over a period of several months and was assisted by strong advocacy from families and connections made possible by the internet and social media (see Editorial Commentary). NGLY1-deficient patients have a striking clinical triad consisting of abnormal tear production, choreoathetosis and liver disease. In addition, global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, hypotonia, EEG abnormalities with or without overt seizures, brain imaging abnormalities, a peripheral neuropathy, constipation and a history of IUGR were common findings. Some patients were noted to have dysmorphic features, but overall these were not considered to be particularly prominent (Table 1). Interestingly, low uE3 was present in three patients, including in two children who died and were found to have significant adrenal cortex vacuolation. Although adrenal function was not specifically evaluated in our patients, some degree of dysfunction remains possible. Further research will be required in order to determine if low uE3 might provide a clue to underlying NGLY1 deficiency.

The constellation of features present in our cohort is in some ways reminiscent of the clinical features present in the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) [16]. CDGs feature multisystem disease involving particularly the central nervous system, heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine system. Indeed, the possibility of an underlying CDG was high in the differential diagnosis for all cases. Based on the initial report of a single NGLY1-deficient patient, a recent CDG review considered that NGLY1 deficiency may even be considered to be the first “congenital disorder of deglycosylation” [17]. Although there are clearly similarities between NGLY1 deficiency and the CDGs as a whole, such as IUGR, failure to thrive, global developmental delay, and liver impairment, these features are non-specific and certain differences also are apparent. Unlike CDGs, NGLY1 deficiency does not appear to be associated with cerebellar atrophy, lipodystrophy, or significant heart manifestations. Our patients commonly had abnormalities detected on brain imaging, but findings were typically mild and non-specific (Table 1). In addition, at this early point of delineation of the clinical phenotypic spectrum, the combination of hypo- or alacrima and a movement disorder consisting of tremulousness and varying degrees of choreoathetosis appear to be pathognomonic for NGLY1 deficiency, but are not particularly associated with CDGs.
 Mitochondrial disorders are also associated with multi-system disease and prominent neuromuscular involvement and such disorders were also considered as diagnostic possibilities in many cases. Lactic acidemia was variably present, but tended to be mild; chronic elevations were not noted in any patient.

Mitochondrial electron transport chain enzymology was also performed in skin fibroblasts and tissues (muscle or liver) when samples were available and no abnormalities were identified. A moderate reduction in mitochondrial DNA content was identified in a liver sample from a Patient 3 (see Supplemental Materials and Methods). Although NGLY1 deficiency clearly involves multiple systems, features more strongly associated with mitochondrial disease, such as basal ganglia involvement, retinitis pigmentosa, cardiomyopathy, liver failure, and renal tubular acidosis were absent [18]. Significant brain disease was noted on autopsy in two siblings (Patients 5 and 6) who were found to have pathological changes consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE has been associated with secondary mitochondrial dysfunction, but is not a typical feature of inherited mitochondrial disorders [19]. Neuronal loss and gliosis may occur in both HIE and mitochondrial disorders, but spongiform degeneration is more typically seen in the latter and was not present in our cases [20]. In short, although mitochondrial disorders may be reasonably placed on the differential diagnosis, the findings in NGLY1 deficiency are not particularly suggestive of this category of disease.

Recently, disorders associated with components of the ERAD pathway involving the Golgi apparatus, ER lipid raft-associated protein 1/2 (erlin1/2) complex, and E3-ubiquitin ligase, have been identified. These conditions serve as interesting comparisons to deficiency of the cytosolic NGLY1. Mutations in MAN1B1, the gene coding for α-1,2-mannosidase, are associated with non-syndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability and subtle dysmorphic features [21]. α-1,2-Mannosidase is a type II transmembrane protein that is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it undergoes O-glycosylation and participates in glycoprotein quality control [22,23]. Profound intellectual disability, developmental regression and multiple contractures are features associated with autosomal recessive mutations in ERLIN2. In this case, abnormal erlin2 causes impaired ERAD of activated inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3) and other substrates by compromising the structure of the erlin1/2 complex [24,25]. Despite the severity of the intellectual disability and neuromuscular findings, the results of brain imaging, electromyography and muscle biopsy appeared normal in the initial erlin2-deficient patients [24]. Another family was found to have a homozygous null mutation in ERLIN2, with affected individuals presenting with a hereditary spastic paraplegia phenotype [26].

IP3 receptors form calcium channels in ER membranes and play an important role in mammalian cell signaling. Ultimately, IP3 receptors undergo rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in response to cell stimulation. Evidence suggests that RNF170, an E3-ubiquitin ligase, mediates ubiquitination and processing of the IP3 receptor via interaction involving the erlin1/2 complex [25,27]. Mutations in RNF170 cause a late- onset autosomal dominant sensory ataxia characterized by distal sensory loss, diminished to absent reflexes, wide-based gait, and normal brain imaging [28–30]. Abnormal E3-ubiquitin ligase activity has also been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of an autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [31]. In short, different steps of the quality control system for targeting and degrading misfolded proteins have been implicated in a number of neurological conditions with varying severity and either autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance.

--- BEGIN TEXT ---
NGLY1 is a cytoplasmic enzyme that participates in the proteasomal degradation of aberrant glycoproteins that are synthesized in the ER and subsequently translocated to the cytoplasm [1,10,32,33]. By performing the initial cleavage of bulky N-glycan chains on misfolded glycoproteins, NGLY1 makes further proteolysis possible; glycoproteins thus trimmed can enter the cylinder of the 20S proteasome to be acted upon by proteases [32]. Therefore, NGLY1 deficiency would be expected to result in accumulation of intact glycoproteins in the cytoplasm. The accumulation of an amorphous substance in the liver of three patients, as well as the vacuolization consistent with storage in two others, is supportive of this role of NGLY1 and may help explain the liver disease noted in our patients. The undefined stored substance likely represents accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins in the cytoplasm that have been retrotranslocated from the ER but cannot undergo further processing. Transferrin isoelectric focusing or mass spectrometry studies in NGLY1-deficient patients have been normal or only subtly abnormal. This is not particularly surprising, because these methods detect the absence or structural alterations of N-glycan chains [34], which would not be expected to accumulate in NGLY1 deficiency.

The presence of axonal loss and gliosis in the brains suggestive of HIE suggests that NGLY1 plays a role in maintaining central nervous system integrity. A study in Caenorhabditis elegans detected peripheral nervous system defects, including aberrant neuronal branching, in animals with loss-of-function mutations in png-1, the ortholog of NGLY1 [35]. Neuronal branching abnormalities possibly relate to the peripheral neuropathy that seems to be relatively common in NGLY1 deficiency, but further studies are needed to determine the underlying pathogenesis of both central and peripheral nervous system abnormalities found in our patients.

The nonsense mutation c.1201A>T (p.R401X) was the most commonly detected deleterious allele in NGLY1, present in homozygous state in five of eight cases (Patients 4 to 8) and in compound heterozygous state in one case (Patient 1). Clearly, homozygous mutations associated with p.R401X cause a severe phenotype. However, the range of outcomes is variable, with some patients having an early demise, and others living at least into their teenage years. Patients 2 and 3 appear to have a relatively mild phenotype and are the only two individuals in the current cohort who do not carry the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation. Aside from these broad considerations, more detailed genotype-phenotype correlations will be possible only with the detection of further patients. Consistent with the severe presentation of NGLY1 deficiency, NGLY1 is amongst the 20th percentile of genes in the human genome that are the most intolerant of functional genetic variation in the human population [36], and we may expect that less extreme mutations than those seen here may also be associated with disease.

--- BEGIN TEXT ---
In summary, NGLY1 deficiency is characterized by a constellation of unique features that should enable clinical recognition of this condition. The more salient features are elevation of AFP and liver enzymes in infancy with relative normalization in early childhood, accumulation of a substance with staining properties similar to glycogen (presumably misfolded glycoproteins) in hepatocyte cytoplasm, absent tears resulting in blepharitis and corneal ulceration, a movement disorder and peripheral neuropathy. However, the transient nature of the AFP and liver transaminase elevation may make older or more mildly affected individuals difficult to detect; therefore, affected older children and adults may remain undiagnosed. However, the widespread clinical availability of WES and whole genome sequencing will likely result in further cases being detected, including those with a more mild phenotype.

    - When a single patient is unambiguously referenced by an identifier, this must be equal to that identifier; typically an integer or anonymized name like "Patient 1" or other arbitrary string 
    - When ALL patients are referenced without individual attribution (i.e. a specific `patient_id` is not clear), use the value "ALL" for this field
    - When SOME patients are referenced without individual attribution (i.e. a specific `patient_id` is not clear), use the value "SOME" for this field
  - `external_study`: If context implies that the patient being referenced is from another study, include any identifying information for that study/reference in this field (e.g. citation numbers or author names); if no such distinction is made, assume it is from the current study and report only the value "NA"
  - `details`: A free-text description of the information discussed for the patient that includes as much detail as possible
- If multiple patient identifiers are referenced at once, repeat the information for them on separate CSV lines with one of those identifiers used in each line (in `patient_id`)
- Ensure that any `details` for a patient can definitively be ascribed to that specific patient
- Report results using a pipe (i.e. "|") delimiter

Abstract
Purpose: The cytosolic enzyme N-glycanase 1, encoded by NGLY1, catalyzes cleavage of the beta-aspartyl glycosylamine bond of N-linked glycoproteins, releasing intact N-glycans from proteins bound for degradation. In this study, we describe the clinical spectrum of NGLY1 deficiency (NGLY1-CDDG).
 Methods: Prospective natural history protocol
Results: In 12 individuals ages 2 to 21 years with confirmed, biallelic, pathogenic NGLY1 mutations, we identified previously unreported clinical features, including optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone dystrophy, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, and lower than predicted resting energy expenditure. Novel laboratory findings include low CSF total protein and albumin, and unusually high antibody titers towards rubella and/or rubeola following vaccination. We also confirmed and further quantified previously reported findings noting that decreased tear production, transient transaminitis, small feet, a complex hyperkinetic movement disorder, and varying degrees of global developmental delay with relatively preserved socialization are the most consistent features.
 Conclusion: Our prospective phenotyping expands the clinical spectrum of NGLY1-CDDG, offers prognostic information, and provides baseline data for evaluating therapeutic interventions.

INTRODUCTION
Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are a group of inborn errors characterized by abnormalities in the process of glycosylation of biomolecules1–3. While more than 100 different CDGs have been reported since the first description by Jaeken et al. in 19804–7, only one congenital disorder of de-glycosylation has been described. NGLY1 deficiency (OMIM: 610661 and 615273), or NGLY1-CDDG, was first reported in 2012 by Need et al., who, through exome sequencing, identified biallelic mutations in the NGLY1 gene as the cause of disease in one child.

Studies included brain magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI and MRS, supplementary methods), routine and overnight electroencephalograms (EEGs) with a limited montage performed during a sleep study, electromyogram (EMG, supplementary methods) and nerve conduction studies (NCS, supplementary methods), indirect calorimetry, awake and sedated eye examination with Schirmer II testing, optical coherence tomography scans and electroretinography, behavioral determination of pure tone thresholds, tympanometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem evoked potentials (ABR), quantitative sweat analysis autonomic testing (QSWEAT, supplementary methods), gastric aspiration, swallow study, skeletal survey, bone age, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), abdominal ultrasound, vibration controlled transient elastography (Fibroscan)12, echocardiogram, and electrocardiogram. Consultations included clinical neurology, audiology, nutrition, ophthalmology, hepatology, growth, puberty and hormonal studies, allergy and immunology, genetic counseling, physiatry, and speech, occupational, and physical therapy. Eleven individuals underwent developmental psychological evaluations, consisting of at least the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 2nd edition. Cognitive function was assessed with testing specific for age and developmental level that provided either an intelligence quotient (IQ) or developmental quotient (DQ) score. In addition, the Nijmegen pediatric CDG rating scale, a measure of clinical disease progression developed for CDG, was applied to all affected individuals younger than 18 years14.

RESULTS 
Molecular Findings
Twelve individuals from ten families with confirmed biallelic mutations in NGLY1 were admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. Subjects 3 and 11 are siblings, and subjects 7 and 8 are siblings. Six individuals (#2, 3, 6, 9, 11, and 12) were included in previous clinical publications. All individuals (six female; six male) were white and ranged from 2.5– 21.3 years of age. We identified 13 different mutations: five missense, five nonsense, two splice site, and one frameshift mutation (Table 1). The most common mutation was c.1201A>T (p.R401*), occurring in seven alleles. The mutations were widely dispersed along the gene with no obvious hotspot. Only four of the mutations lay within the catalytic domain (Figure 1). Family histories are detailed in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Nijmegen Scores
The 11 individuals under age 18 years were evaluated using the Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Severity scale. Total Nijmegen scores ranged from 9 (mild) to 52 (severe), with a mean of 28 ± 4 (SEM); the median was 32 (Table 1, Supplementary Table S1). Based on definitions by Achouitar et al14, three individuals scored in the mild range, two in the moderate range, and six in the severe range. All five individuals carrying the common mutation c.1201A>T were either moderately or severely impaired; those carrying at least one copy had a higher mean score (36) than those without this mutation (20.5) (p=0.0184). The sibling pair (individuals 7 and 8) with a private cryptic splice site mutation (c.930C>T) and a private nonsense mutation (c.622C>T) both exhibited relatively mild impairment in all domains. All other mutations were private, precluding additional genotype-phenotype correlations. There was no significant difference in disease severity of males compared to females (data not shown).

Development
All twelve subjects had at least some developmental delay or intellectual disability, with a broad range of severity (Table 1 and S1).

Neurologic Phenotype
Seven of twelve subjects had clinical seizures, and one had subclinical seizures recognized on previous EEG. Details regarding age of onset, seizure type and frequency, medications, and EEG findings are noted in Supplementary Table S. On overnight EEG, only one individual (#6) had active seizures recorded, but seven had multifocal epileptiform activity. There were no age or genotype differences between individuals having seizures and those without. In fact, in each sibling pair, one had seizures and the other did not.
 All twelve individuals exhibited hyperkinetic movement disorders that included choreiform, athetoid, dystonic, myoclonic, action tremor, and dysmetric movements and were more severe in the younger individuals (Supplementary Movie S1).

Brain MRI and MRS
Eleven individuals underwent MRI and MRS of the brain. Clinical assessment of the images was not striking (Figure 3). Delayed myelination was present in three of the four youngest individuals, but all the older individuals had complete myelination. Six of nine individuals had qualitatively-evident cerebral atrophy that ranged from slight to moderate. Four individuals (#1, #2, #6, #10) also had slight cerebellar atrophy. The atrophy tended to be greater in the older individuals (p=0.17, Supplementary Figure S3), and in one teenager (#11) follow-up imaging showed atrophy measurably worse after a 20-month interval (net loss of 34 cm3 relative to expected). Increased atrophy correlated with worsening of all functional measurements (Supplementary Figure S3), including IQ or DQ (p<0.03), Vineland assessments (p<0.03), and Nijmegen scores (p=0.01). Brain volume also directly correlated with CSF levels of 5-HIAA (p=0.03), tetrahydrobiopterin (p=0.02), and 5-HVA (p=0.06) (Supplementary Figure S3).

Compared to the reference population, N-acetylaspartylglutamate + N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was lower than normal in the left centrum semiovale (LCSO) (p=0.004), the midline parietal grey matter (PGM) (p=0.02), and superior cerebellar vermis (SVERM) (p<0.0001).

Multiple correlations between these MRS-measured metabolites and age, functional assessments, brain volume, and neurotransmitters in the CSF were found (Supplementary Figure S3). The general trend showed that the differences noted above became more pronounced with increasing age, worsening function, and lower brain volume (Supplementary Figure S4). MRS metabolite measurements did not correlate with total CSF protein, CSF albumin, or CSF/serum albumin ratio. There was a weak correlation (p=0.09) between atrophy and total CSF protein, but not CSF albumin or CSF/serum albumin ratio.

CSF Laboratory Results
Nine subjects underwent lumbar puncture. CSF total protein and albumin concentrations, as well as the CSF/serum albumin ratios, were low in nearly all individuals (Supplementary Table S3). There was no correlation between age and CSF protein or albumin levels. In the two oldest subjects, CSF 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were decreased, suggesting neuronal loss. Neopterin levels were normal but decreased with age, and CSF tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels were below the lower limit of normal in all but one subject tested; however, there was no correlation with age. CSF 5-HIAA, HVA, and BH4 levels strongly and directly correlated with brain atrophy. CSF lactate and amino acid levels were essentially normal (Supplementary Table S3). CSF leucocyte counts (0–4; normal 0–5), glucose concentrations (54–72 mg/dL; normal 40–70), 3-O-methyldopa concentrations (12–28 nM; normal <150) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations (45– 85 nmol/L; normal 40–150) were unremarkable (data not shown).

NCS, EMG, and QSWEAT Testing
Nerve conduction studies were performed in 11 individuals (Supplementary Table S4). The predominant finding was an axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (n=8) with additional demyelinative features (n=6). Results of neurophysiological testing demonstrated a length- dependent, progressive loss of sensory and motor axons and sympathetic nerve function, apparently static abnormalities in myelination of peripheral nerves, and possible motor neuron degeneration. A single individual (#6) had a repeat study at one year, showing progression of the neuropathy. On needle EMG, neurogenic findings were noted in 9 subjects with varying degrees of acute and chronic changes consistent with the NCS results.

ALL|NA|Audiologic assessments, including otoacoustic emissions and/or cochlear microphonics to evaluate for the functional integrity of the inner ear, and auditory brainstem response (ABRs), were conducted on 11 subjects. Behavioral hearing thresholds could be established reliably in only three subjects and all had normal hearing sensitivity. Tympanometry was unremarkable. Most remarkable was the dyssynchronous and/or absent transmission through the auditory brainstem and/or 8th nerve in most individuals. The severity of the transmission abnormality through the auditory brainstem increased with increasing age, and the eighth nerve was bilaterally involved the 4 oldest individuals.

Clinical Feeding and Swallowing Assessments
Clinical feeding and modified barium swallow assessments were performed on 11 subjects. Oral motor deficits, including persistent nutritive suckle swallow and poor oral bolus formation, were present in 10 of 11. Premature spillage and pharyngeal swallow response delays remained the primary deficits of all subjects. No aspiration or laryngeal penetration for any textures were observed in the swallow studies. Developmental delays in m astication were evident and characterized by munching patterns without matured rotary chewing of solid textures. Generalized weakness of the lips and tongue was observed in all individuals during cranial nerve assessments. Dystonic movements of the tongue and persistent oral reflexes of suckling and suck/swallows were seen in the majority of individuals.

Gastrointestinal and Nutritional Findings
Gastric pH was assessed after H2 blockers and osmotic pump inhibitors had been discontinued for 5 days. Gastric pH was appropriately acidic in all individuals tested except one, whose pH was 7.25. Ten of twelve individuals had some degree of constipation. Abdominal ultrasounds were normal in six of 12 individuals. Abnormalities in abdominal ultrasound included splenomegaly, steatosis, coarse or inhomogeneous liver texture, or hepatomegaly. No hydronephrosis, polycystic kidneys, horseshoe kidneys, kidney calculi, nephrocalcinosis, or perinephric fluid were seen. Three of twelve had Fibroscan scores above 7 kPa, the upper limit of normal, indicating possible liver fibrosis. Resting energy expenditure was close to 100% of expected in three individuals, but ranged from 51% to 82% of predicted in the other 9 (data not shown).
 Laboratory values reflecting gastrointestinal and hepatic function were essentially normal at the time of the NIH evaluation (Supplementary Table S7). However, chart review revealed elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) in all eight subjects that had these measured in their first two years of life. One individual had undergone liver transplantation for presumed hepatocellular carcinoma (further details in Supplementary Materials and Methods). These transaminase levels normalized around age 4 (Supplementary Figure S5). Circulating proteins were normal or borderline low in all individuals (Supplementary Table S7). Total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides were also low (Supplementary Table S7). In the two subjects with the lowest cholesterol levels, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and very low density lipoprotein particle number and sizes were normal (data not shown).

Musculoskeletal Findings
Bone age was delayed in eight of the 11 subjects tested without any consistent abnormalities of the endocrine system: the somatotropic axis and thyroid function were normal in all studied individuals. Femoral bone density was low in all nine individuals who underwent DEXA scanning (mean, SEM z-scores for 8 patients < 21 years adjacent to the growth plate = −3, 0.4; metaphysis-diaphysis = −2.2, 0.6, and diaphysis = −1.8, 0.5). All subjects had joint hypermobility except the older ones, who had contractures in both small and large joints. Complete skeletal surveys were performed on 11 individuals; abnormalities included coxa valga (n=11), scoliosis (n=6), growth arrest lines or metaphyseal banding without palmidronate treatment (n=4), dislocations or subluxations involving the hips and shoulder joints (n=3), and sclerosis of the phalanges or tarsal bones (n=2). Findings noted only once included flexion deformity of the fingers, hallux valgus, sclerotic lesion of the distal femur, thinning of the fibulas, prominent apophyseal bone formation in the ileac crests and ischia, ulnar bowing, expansion of the cortexes in the proximal and middle phalanges in digits 2–4, widened phalanges, and shortened and widened metatarsals.

DISCUSSION
Summary of Novel Findings
Our prospective investigations into NGLY1-CDDG revealed several new discoveries associated with this disorder. These included low CSF total protein and albumin, optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone dystrophy, poor weight gain starting in mid- childhood, lower than predicted resting energy expenditure, central and obstructive sleep apnea, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, progressive brain atrophy, abnormalities in brain MRS-measured metabolites, various abnormalities on skeletal survey, high antibody titers after rubella and rubeola vaccination, and low levels of several pro- and anti- coagulation factors. Echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and CSF lactate levels were normal.

Compared with previously reported biopsy findings, our transient elastography results showed minimal if any fibrosis. In addition, we could not confirm abnormal storage material in the three liver biopsy specimens we analyzed, nor did we observe ocular apraxia in our individuals, despite performing detailed ophthalmologic evaluations that involved some subjects previously reported to have ocular apraxia.

Therapeutic Implications
Several specific phenotypic findings have therapeutic implications. The auditory neural pathway dysfunction without peripheral hearing loss resembles that observed in auditory neuropathy. Persons with auditory neuropathy experience difficulty hearing in the presence of background noise and benefit from quiet listening environments. If hypohidrosis is detected, preventative measures (hydration, ventilation, etc.) against situations that cause dangerous core body hyperthermia can be taken. It is important to aggressively manage hypo-lacrima with artificial tears and bland ointment to prevent secondary complications that can impact vision. The finding of disordered mastication for solids but a functional ability to swallow suggests the need for oral motor and swallowing therapies for all subjects to facilitate better control and chewing maturation.

Hypotheses Generated for Pathophysiology of Clinical Findings
Our detailed assessment of the phenotypic features has also led to several hypotheses regarding underlying pathophysiology. The strong correlation between brain atrophy on MRI and functional assessments suggests that loss of neurons contributes to the functional impairment. The atrophy also correlated with CSF metabolites (BH4, 5-HIAA, HVA), which are known to be lower when there is damage to neurotransmitter producing neurons. This suggests that these biochemical abnormalities may be secondary to brain atrophy.

Results from MRS showed that as functional impairment worsened and age increased, NAA decreased, while choline, myo-inositol and creatine increased. Additionally, creatine and myoinositol were inversely correlated, and NAA directly correlated, with neurotransmitter levels (5-HIAA, 5-HVA, 3-OMD, and neopterin, Supplementary Figure S3). NAA may be found exclusively in neurons and declines as neurons become unhealthy or die. Elevations in choline could be consistent with a relative abundance of glial cells secondary to neuronal loss. Myo-inositol is a glia-specific marker that is elevated by gliosis or inflammation; in our cohort we do not have any evidence of inflammation. Creatine levels are relatively higher in glial cells compared to neurons. Taken together, the MRS findings suggest that there is a relative abundance of glial cells compared to neurons in the brain of NGLY1-CDDG individuals, possibly due to loss of neurons, and that the degree of this imbalance contributes significantly to the severity of the phenotype.

The impaired sweat response, largely affecting distal responses, is consistent with a small fiber neuropathy rather than a central etiology or generalized cholinergic dysfunction. Albumin CSF/serum quotient, or QAlb, is a marker of blood-CSF barrier dysfunction, and its value is inversely correlated to the CSF turnover rate. There was no significant change in the QAlb ratio (data not shown), arguing against increased turnover as a possible etiology. Regardless of the mechanism, we propose that decreased CSF protein and albumin concentrations represent a novel diagnostic marker for this disorder.

Individuals with NGLY1-CDDG and those with N-linked glycosylation disorders share the phenotypic features of low cholesterol, hepatopathy, peripheral neuropathy, retinal and optic nerve abnormalities, seizures, developmental delay with socialization as a relative strength, and delayed bone age. NGLY1-CDDG also overlaps with O-linked glycosylation disorders with respect to hypolacrima. There may be a pathogenic relationship; N-glycanase 1 catalyzes the cleavage of the amide bond between the proximal N-acetylglucosamine residue of glycans and the asparagine residue of the protein9, so NGLY1-CDDG could impair glycan recycling and lead to hypoglycosylation. Indeed, the individuals with NGLY1-CDDG exhibited subtle abnormalities in transferrin and ApoC-III glycosylation.

Another hypothesis for the etiology of the NGLY1-CDDG phenotype is based on the fact that misfolded glycoproteins are processed through the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway (ERAD) and then retrotranslocated into the cytoplasm. There, N-glycanase is the first step in further degradation of these molecules, making ERAD dysfunction a possible pathophysiologic contributor especially given evidence of ER-stress in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, preliminary experiments found no impairment or enhancement of standard ERAD marker expression under normal conditions in NGLY1-CDDG patient fibroblasts (H.H. Freeze, personal communication, April 2016).

Age Progression of Disease and Implications for Future Therapeutic Trials
Our study, which documents cross-sectional findings and covers a large range of ages, indicates that NGLY1-CDDG is a progressive disorder. The Nijmegen severity scores and Vineland scores indicated worsening function with age. Also progressive were the peripheral neuropathy, auditory neural dysfunction, scoliosis, inability to maintain weight, brain atrophy on MRI, abnormalities in brain metabolites measured on MRS, and CSF neurotransmitter levels. However, other aspects of N-glycanase deficiency appear static or even regressive. Hypolacrima occurred at all ages, and the hepatopathy and hyperkinetic movement disorder appeared to improve with age. These observations provide a guide to determine reliable outcome measures for efficacy in future therapeutic trials. Effective outcome measures would derive from findings that are progressive, such as brain volume, choline levels on MRS, nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes, and auditory brainstem evoked responses.

Requirements:

- Exclude any patients where context dictates that they do NOT have NGLY1 deficiency, e.g. when NGLY1 deficiency patients are compared to similar patients with other diseases.
- Extract as much information as possible about each patient including associated genotypes, phenotypes, physical or behavioral traits, demographics, lab measurements, treatments, family histories or anything else of clinical and/or biological relevance.
- Extract this information in CSV format with the following headers:
  - `patient_id`: Identifying information for the patient within the context of the article
    - When a single patient is unambiguously referenced by an identifier, this must be equal to that identifier; typically an integer or anonymized name like "Patient 1" or other arbitrary string 
    - When ALL patients are referenced without individual attribution (i.e. a specific `patient_id` is not clear), use the value "ALL" for this field
    - When SOME patients are referenced without individual attribution (i.e. a specific `patient_id` is not clear), use the value "SOME" for this field
  - `external_study`: If context implies that the patient being referenced is from another study, include any identifying information for that study/reference in this field (e.g. citation numbers or author names); if no such distinction is made, assume it is from the current study and report only the value "NA"
  - `details`: A free-text description of the information discussed for the patient that includes as much detail as possible
- If multiple patient identifiers are referenced at once, repeat the information for them on separate CSV lines with one of those identifiers used in each line (in `patient_id`)
- Ensure that any `details` for a patient can definitively be ascribed to that specific patient
- Report results using a pipe (i.e. "|") delimiter 
- Include the CSV headers in the result
- If the text contains no patient information, report only the CSV headers
- Do NOT include explanation of any kind in the results; report only the CSV content

Figure 2: Facial features of NGLY1-CDDG.
 Individuals with NGLY1-CDDG are arranged from youngest (top left) to oldest (bottom right). Facial features include upturned nasal tip, hypotonic facies, ptosis, brachycephaly, thinned facies, hollowed cheeks, and visible zygomatic arches. Interpupillary distance ranged from the 13–95 centiles with the mean at the 66th centile, and SEM of 8. Horizontal fissure length ranged from 3–70 centiles with mean at the 20th centile, and SEM of 1. Inner canthal distance ranged from 3–100 centiles with the mean at the 59th centile and SEM of 10. Outer canthal distance ranged from 6–81 centile with mean at the 43 centile and SEM of 7. Canthal index ranged from −2 to +2 SD from the normal mean.

Figure 3: Brain MRI findings.
 White matter lesions were seen in two of eleven individuals. A shows multiple lesions in the periventricular white matter, some of which were confluent. B shows a single lesion in the periventricular white matter. Both A and B illustrate cerebral atrophy and were performed using T2-weighting. Sulci are slightly prominent in both A and B, and prominent ventricles are visible in A. C illustrates high position of the cerebellar tonsils, and large foramen of Magendie and cisterna magna.
