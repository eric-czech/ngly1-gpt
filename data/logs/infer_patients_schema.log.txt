No epileptiform discharge localization was observed. Background slowing was present with a PDR of 7 Hertz. Anterior/Posterior gradient was present.
- Significant brain disease was noted on autopsy in Patient 6 who was found to have pathological changes consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).
- Schirmera: 0 ; 0, Ptosis / Lagophthalmous: + / +, Nystagmus / Strabismus: -, Cornea: Scarring; NV, Retina: No view (corneal scar), Optic Atrophy: +, Refraction: ND
- DNA was capture- sequenced using a commercially developed capture reagent (VCRome2). Sequence data were generated on an Illumina HiSeq2000 producing an average coverage of 80× with >90% of targeted bases at 20× coverage or higher.
- 6 year old male with NGLY1 deficiency. Allele 1 mutation: c.1604G>A (p.W535*). Allele 2 mutation: c.1910delT (p.L637*). Nijmegen score: 25. IQ or DQ: 8. Vineland score: 43.
- Distal muscle wasting and finger contractures are noted. There are irregular brief adventitious movements of the hands worsened by action or posture. While some of the movements are reminiscent of cerebellar dysfunction, her gait assisted by a walker, demonstrates a narrow stance. While unable to articulate, she is able to express herself via a communication device and has a happy disposition.
- Patient 6 had onset of seizures at 1 year with initial types being Drop and Myoclonic. The patient experienced several Myoclonus, staring, gelastic, and drop seizures per day. The patient was on Valproate and Lamotrigine medication. Multifocal to Diffuse epileptiform discharge localization was observed. Mild background slowing was present with a PDR of 5-6 Hertz. Anterior/Posterior gradient was poorly formed during the day and present during the night.
- Patient 8 has a homozygous nonsense mutation, R401X, at position 3:25775422 (hg19) in transcript ENST00000280700. At the cDNA level this is c.1201A>T in exon 8 of NGLY1.
- Sibling of patient 3, has confirmed biallelic mutations in NGLY1, included in previous clinical publications.
- Patient 6 has Protein level of 5 mg/dL, Albumin level of 3 mg/dL, CSF/serum Albumin quotient of 0.9, 5HIAA level of 163 nM, HVA level of 385 nM, Neopterin level of 14 nM, BH4 level of 10 nM, Lactate level of 1.2 mM, and normal Amino acids.
- Patient 8 never had seizures. The patient was on Levetiracetam medication. Generalized epileptiform discharge localization was observed. No background slowing was present with a PDR of 9-10 Hertz. Anterior/Posterior gradient was present.
- Individual #1 had slight cerebellar atrophy.
- Schirmera: 0 ; 1, Ptosis / Lagophthalmous: + / +, Nystagmus / Strabismus: + / XT, Cornea: NV; pannus, Retina: Normal, Optic Atrophy: -, Refraction: Hyperopia; Myopia
- A 2-year-old boy, delivered by Cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation after fetal distress was noted on cardiotocography. Pregnancy history was positive for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and oligohydramnios. He had mild hyperbilirubinemia, but otherwise his neonatal course was unremarkable and he was discharged on day of life three. Intermittent head flexion was noted at 6 months, and an EEG at 8 months showed generalized poly-spike discharges. Soon thereafter, mild tonic seizures with head and body flexion started, and evolved to single, symmetric spasms with bilateral arm extension. Involuntary movements of the upper extremities were also noted at this time. In addition, global developmental delay, bilateral ptosis, abnormal tear production, elevated liver transaminases (3 to 4 times upper limit of normal), and constipation were noted in infancy. He has had recurrent episodes of keratoconjunctivitis and poor lid closure during sleep with resultant corneal scarring.
- Patient 2 underwent Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) at Baylor College of Medicine Whole Genome Laboratory, which revealed a homozygous mutation in exon 9 of the NGLY1 gene, denoted as c.1370dupG or p.R458fs. Both parents were confirmed to be heterozygous carriers by Sanger sequencing. The mutation causes a frame shift in codon 458, causing insertion of 13 incorrect residues before a stop codon is introduced towards the end of exon 9. The mutation was not seen in any of 3321 other subjects sequenced at Duke, nor was it seen in 6503 subjects on the Exome Variant Server (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA).
- Schirmera: ND, Ptosis / Lagophthalmous: - / +, Nystagmus / Strabismus: - / XT, Cornea: pannus, Retina: Normal, Optic Atrophy: +, Refraction: Hyperopia
- A 5-year-old male who presented in the neonatal period with involuntary movements, including athetosis involving the trunk and extremities and constant lip smacking and pursing while awake. Pregnancy and birth history were unremarkable. He had mild neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy, but otherwise appeared well. Global developmental delay, hypotonia, intractable multifocal epilepsy, consisting of myoclonic seizures, drop attacks, and staring or tonic episodes, and liver disease were present in infancy. He has cortical vision loss and congenital alacrima and corneal ulcerations with scarring were noted at age 4 years. Now, at age 5 years, the movement disorder has not abated and he has central hypotonia and global developmental delay.
- Individual #2 had slight cerebellar atrophy.
- Patient 4 never had seizures. No information on medication, epileptiform discharge localization, background slowing, PDR, and Anterior/Posterior gradient was determined.
- Sanger sequencing (Duke University) detected a homozygous nonsense mutation, p.R401X, at position 3:25775422 (hg19) in transcript ENST00000280700. At the cDNA level this is c.1201A>T in exon 8 of NGLY1. This finding was confirmed in a CLIA- certified laboratory (GeneDx).
- Random multifocal irregular adventitious movements of all four extremities are induced by voluntary movements and or posture. Head and trunk titubation during the crawling position or during supported gait may reflect axial cerebellar dysfunction and/or associated negative motor phenomena (negative myoclonus) leading to sudden brief loss of postural muscle tone.
- 5 year old female with NGLY1 deficiency. Allele 1 mutation: c.931G>A (p.E311K). Allele 2 mutation: c.730T>C (p.W244R). Nijmegen score: 33. IQ or DQ: Not determined. Vineland score: Not determined.
- Patient 7 had onset of seizures at 6 years with initial type being Absence. The patient experienced 100s of staring seizures per day. The patient was on Lamotrigine and Topiramate medication. Generalized epileptiform discharge localization was observed. Mild background slowing was present with a PDR of 7-8 Hertz. Anterior/Posterior gradient was present.
- 10 year old male with NGLY1 deficiency. Allele 1 mutation: c.622C>T (p.Q208*). Allele 2 mutation: c.930C>T (p.G310G (splice site)). Nijmegen score: 9. IQ or DQ: 81. Vineland score: 94.
- Individual 8 with a private cryptic splice site mutation (c.930C>T) and a private nonsense mutation (c.622C>T) exhibited relatively mild impairment in all domains.
- WES was performed on a clinical basis.
- Patient 7 has normal sensory and motor nerves, borderline slow conduction velocity (CV), normal electromyogram (EMG) findings, and present quantitative sweat analysis (QSWEAT) findings in both arm and ankle.
- Patient 2 is a 20 year old Caucasian female. She has consanguinity. Her mutations are c.1370dupG(p.R458fs)/c.1370dupG(p.R458fs). She has IUGR, microcephaly, global developmental delay, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, ocular apraxia, alacrima/hypolacrima, corneal ulcerations/scarring, elevated liver transaminases, liver storage or vacuolization, constipation, scoliosis, and peripheral neuropathy.
- 17 year old female with NGLY1 deficiency. Allele 1 mutation: c.1201A>T (p.R401*). Allele 2 mutation: c.1201A>T (p.R401*). Nijmegen score: 25. IQ or DQ: 16. Vineland score: 42.

- Patient 9 had onset of seizures at 1 year with initial types being Tonic and Myoclonic. The patient experienced 0-3 Tonic and Myoclonic seizures per day. The patient was on Levetiracetam medication. Multifocal epileptiform discharge localization was observed. Mild to Moderate background slowing was present with a PDR of 10-11 Hertz. Anterior/Posterior gradient was present.
- Patient 5 has a homozygous single nucleotide variant T> A at position 3:25775422 (hg19) in NGLY1, which was validated by Sanger sequencing. This variant causes a nonsense mutation, R401X. The variant was also present in the mother’s exome as a heterozygous call.
- Patient 6 is the younger sister of Subject 5. The pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screen for trisomy 18 and SLOS (AFP 0.87 MoM, uE3 0.31 MoM, hCG 0.57 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal female karyotype. She was delivered by Cesarean section at 35 weeks of gestation following an ultrasound that was concerning for IUGR. She had jaundice requiring phototherapy, but her course in the nursery was otherwise uneventful. By age 9 months, developmental delay was apparent and she had developed hypotonia, microcephaly, a mildly myopathic- appearing face and constant involuntary movements with a tendency to hyperextend her arms and close her fists. At 9 1⁄2 months of age, she died unexpectedly in her sleep and the cause of death remains unknown.
- Patient 7 is a 3 year old Caucasian female. She does not have consanguinity. Her mutations are c.1201A>Y(p. R401X)/c.1201A>T(p.R401X). She does not have IUGR. She has global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, ocular apraxia, alacrima/hypolacrima, neonatal jaundice, elevated liver transaminases, lactic acidosis, constipation, dysmorphic features, and chalazions.
- On overnight EEG, only one individual (#6) had active seizures recorded.
- Schirmera: 7 ; 3, Ptosis / Lagophthalmous: - / +, Nystagmus / Strabismus: + (endgaze) / Ortho, Cornea: Normal, Retina: Blonde periphery, Optic Atrophy: -, Refraction: Normal
- Patient 9 has peripheral neuropathy (PN) in sensory and motor nerves, demyelinative conduction velocity (CV), chronic neurogenic and active denervation in limbs, and present QSWEAT findings in arm but absent in ankle.
- Patient 11 had onset of seizures at 10 years with initial type being Absence. The patient experienced few to 100s of head bobbing seizures per day. The patient was on Levetiracetam medication. Multifocal epileptiform discharge localization was observed. Mild background slowing was present with a PDR of 9 Hertz. Anterior/Posterior gradient was present.
- Individual 7 with a private cryptic splice site mutation (c.930C>T) and a private nonsense mutation (c.622C>T) exhibited relatively mild impairment in all domains.
- The patient and parents were sequenced using both Illumina HiSeq2000 and Complete Genomics platforms. Variants in Illumina-sequenced reads were called using both the Hugeseq and Real Time Genomics pipelines and Complete Genomics variants were identified by their own variant callers.
- Patient 4's nerve conduction study (NCS), electromyogram (EMG), and quantitative sweat analysis (QSWEAT) results were not determined (ND).
- Sibling of patient 11, has confirmed biallelic mutations in NGLY1, included in previous clinical publications.
- Patient 3 does not carry the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation and appears to have a relatively mild phenotype.
- Sanger sequencing of NGLY1 was performed and results were confirmed by a clinical laboratory (GeneDx, Gaithersburg, Maryland).
- Patient 3 is a 4-year-old girl who was born via Cesarean section at term due to a non-reassuring fetal heart tracing. She was monitored in the NICU due to poor feeding and lethargy. Her pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester screen noting increased risk for Smith-Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and trisomy 18, but karyotype on amniocentesis was normal. As a neonate, she had hyperbilirubinemia that was treated with phototherapy and was noted to have elevated liver transaminases and transient thrombocytopenia. In infancy, she was noted to have global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, bilateral exotropia, hypotonia, constipation, and intermittent mild lactic acidemia. At approximately age 1 year, the parents noticed that she did not make tears when crying, although she had adequate tear production to keep her eyes moist. She has had intermittent chalazions, but no corneal scarring. She also developed staring spells, lasting up to 15 seconds, at approximately age 1 year; these episodes occur about once daily and can be interrupted by gentle contact. By age 17 months she had developed an extrapyramidal movement disorder consisting of asynchronous myoclonic jerks of the limbs and shoulders and subtle choreoathetotic movements of the hands and fingers. At 4 years she can ambulate unassisted, although her gait is unsteady, and communicates with vocalizations, gestures and use of a speech-generating device.
- Patient 5, a boy, died at the age of 5 years. He was born at term following a pregnancy that was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screening for trisomy 18 and Smith- Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal male karyotype and measurement of 7-dehydrocholesterol in amniotic fluid excluded SLOS. He was delivered by Cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation due to concerns for IUGR and a non-reassuring stress test. He had mild flexion contractures of both knees, but had an uneventful neonatal period. He had global developmental delay and constant movements of his arms and legs since early infancy and developed head bobbing at 7 months. At 8 months, liver transaminase elevations (approximately 1.5 times the upper limit of normal) were noted, and the elevations persisted until age 3 1⁄2 years. His reflexes appeared normal in infancy, but were diminished by age 2 years and at 38 months could no longer be elicited. During the second year of life, he was noted to have dry eyes that were treated with lubricant drops at bedtime, and microcephaly was present by 16 months. At 2 1⁄2 years, he developed myoclonic seizures that became intractable despite numerous therapeutic trials. Between the ages of 10 months and five years, he showed slow developmental progress, but regressed during the last year. He died at age 5 years following a viral illness and a prolonged seizure.

- Schirmera: 3 ; 1, Ptosis / Lagophthalmous: +/, Nystagmus / Strabismus: - / Ortho, Cornea: Normal, Retina: Blonde periphery; pigment granularity, Optic Atrophy: -, Refraction: Hyperopia
- Significant brain disease was noted on autopsy in Patient 5 who was found to have pathological changes consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).
- Patient 12 has peripheral neuropathy (PN) in sensory and motor nerves, not recordable conduction velocity (CV), connective tissue replacement of muscle, some active and chronic neurogenic findings, and present QSWEAT findings in arm but absent in ankle.
- Patient 2, a now 20-year-old female, was born at 39 weeks of gestation via Cesarean section because of intrauterine growth retardation and an abnormal appearing placenta. At four months of age, hypotonia, developmental delay and elevated liver transaminases were noted. At approximately 4 years of age, a slight intention tremor and frequent involuntary movements of her neck, hands and arm were observed. At 5 years of age, she was noted to have ocular apraxia, distal tapering of hands and feet, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. She has cortical vision impairment, as well as alacrima and dry eyes that require lubrication, but has not developed corneal scarring. Presently, she has marked intellectual disabilities and requires total care. She has very little expressive speech and communicates through an electronic speech-generating device. She continues to ambulate with a walker.
- Patient 8 has normal sensory and motor nerves, borderline slow conduction velocity (CV), mild chronic neurogenic findings, and present quantitative sweat analysis (QSWEAT) findings in both arm and ankle.
- Patient 7 is a 3-year-old girl, born at term via scheduled Cesarean section. She had mild jaundice at birth but no other neonatal complications. Prenatal screen showed an increased risk for trisomy 21. In infancy, she was noted to have strabismus, hypotonia, athetoid arm and hand movements, clasped hands, and elevated liver transaminases (approximately 3 times upper limit of normal). Microcephaly was present by age 2 years. Severe developmental delay was present, but she has shown slow progress without regression. She learned to sit alone and started to crawl at 2 years, but had no words.

- Patient 3 has Protein level of 12 mg/dL, Albumin level of 8 mg/dL, CSF/serum Albumin quotient of 2.4, 5HIAA level of 83 nM, HVA level of 206 nM, Neopterin level of 17 nM, BH4 level of 8 nM, Lactate level of 1.3 mM, and Glycine in Amino acids.
- Handwriting elicits jerky irregular hand movements. Finger-nose-finger testing is accomplished with an irregular tremulous trajectory. During this phase of the exam, a brief seizure is captured with associated behavioral arrest and tonic upward deviation of her eyes lasting a few seconds. Rapid finger movements are slow and irregular but her gait is not ataxic. Myoclonus (positive and negative) are evident when holding her arms against gravity.
- Distal upper and lower extremities have developed a flexion contracture at the hands and feet. Irregular action-induced jerking movements are elicited while reaching. Gaze is conjugate. Visual pursuit is normal and there is generalized arreflexia. Muscle wasting notable throughout, especially in the lower extremities likely secondary to peripheral neuropathy.
- Patient 12 never had seizures. No epileptiform discharge localization was observed. Mild background slowing was present with a PDR of 11 Hertz. Anterior/Posterior gradient was present.
