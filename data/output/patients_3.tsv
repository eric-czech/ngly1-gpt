Original Patient	Original Patient	Need et al.	3-year-old boy with compound heterozygous inactivating mutations in NGLY1. Clinical phenotype suggestive of a congenital disorder of glycosylation, although repeated transferrin isoelectric focusing and N-glycan analyses were normal. Liver biopsy showed accumulation of an amorphous unidentified substance throughout the cytoplasm, a finding likely consistent with NGLY1 dysfunction, which would be expected to result in abnormal accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins because of impaired cytosolic degradation.

1	1		5-year-old male, presented in the neonatal period with involuntary movements, including athetosis involving the trunk and extremities and constant lip smacking and pursing while awake. Pregnancy and birth history were unremarkable. He had mild neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy, but otherwise appeared well. Global developmental delay, hypotonia, intractable multifocal epilepsy, consisting of myoclonic seizures, drop attacks, and staring or tonic episodes, and liver disease were present in infancy. He has cortical vision loss and congenital alacrima and corneal ulcerations with scarring were noted at age 4 years. Now, at age 5 years, the movement disorder has not abated and he has central hypotonia and global developmental delay.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
2	2		20-year-old female, born at 39 weeks of gestation via Cesarean section due to intrauterine growth retardation and an abnormal appearing placenta. Noted hypotonia, developmental delay and elevated liver transaminases at four months of age. At approximately 4 years of age, observed to have a slight intention tremor and frequent involuntary movements of her neck, hands and arm. At 5 years of age, she was noted to have ocular apraxia, distal tapering of hands and feet, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. She has cortical vision impairment, alacrima and dry eyes that require lubrication, but has not developed corneal scarring. Presently, she has marked intellectual disabilities and requires total care. She has very little expressive speech and communicates through an electronic speech-generating device. She continues to ambulate with a walker.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
3	3		4-year-old girl, born via Cesarean section at term for a non-reassuring fetal heart tracing, monitored in the NICU due to poor feeding and lethargy. Pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester screen noting increased risk for Smith-Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and trisomy 18, but karyotype on amniocentesis was normal. As a neonate, she had hyperbilirubinemia treated with phototherapy, elevated liver transaminases and transient thrombocytopenia. In infancy, she had global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, bilateral exotropia, hypotonia, constipation, and intermittent mild lactic acidemia. At age 1 year, she did not make tears when crying, but had adequate tear production to keep her eyes moist. She had intermittent chalazions, but no corneal scarring. She developed staring spells, lasting up to 15 seconds, at approximately age 1 year; these episodes occur about once daily and can be interrupted by gentle contact. By age 17 months she had developed an extrapyramidal movement disorder consisting of asynchronous myoclonic jerks of the limbs and shoulders and subtle choreoathetotic movements of the hands and fingers. At 4 years she can ambulate unassisted, although her gait is unsteady, and communicates with vocalizations, gestures and use of a speech-generating device.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
4	4		2-year-old boy, delivered by Cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation after fetal distress was noted on cardiotocography. Pregnancy history was positive for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and oligohydramnios. He had mild hyperbilirubinemia, but otherwise his neonatal course was unremarkable and he was discharged on day of life three. Intermittent head flexion was noted at 6 months, and an EEG at 8 months showed generalized poly-spike discharges. Soon thereafter, mild tonic seizures with head and body flexion started, and evolved to single, symmetric spasms with bilateral arm extension. Involuntary movements of the upper extremities were also noted at this time. In addition, global developmental delay, bilateral ptosis, abnormal tear production, elevated liver transaminases (3 to 4 times upper limit of normal), and constipation were noted in infancy. He has had recurrent episodes of keratoconjunctivitis and poor lid closure during sleep with resultant corneal scarring.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
5	5		Patient 5, a boy, died at the age of 5 years. He was born at term following a pregnancy that was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screening for trisomy 18 and Smith- Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) (AFP 1.97 MoM, uE3 0.24 MoM and hCG 0.48 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal male karyotype and measurement of 7-dehydrocholesterol in amniotic fluid excluded SLOS. He was delivered by Cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation due to concerns for IUGR and a non-reassuring stress test. He had mild flexion contractures of both knees, but had an uneventful neonatal period. He had global developmental delay and constant movements of his arms and legs since early infancy and developed head bobbing at 7 months. At 8 months, liver transaminase elevations (approximately 1.5 times the upper limit of normal) were noted, and the elevations persisted until age 3 1⁄2 years. His reflexes appeared normal in infancy, but were diminished by age 2 years and at 38 months could no longer be elicited. During the second year of life, he was noted to have dry eyes that were treated with lubricant drops at bedtime, and microcephaly was present by 16 months. At 2 1⁄2 years, he developed myoclonic seizures that became intractable despite numerous therapeutic trials. Between the ages of 10 months and five years, he showed slow developmental progress, but regressed during the last year. He died at age 5 years following a viral illness and a prolonged seizure.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
6	6		Patient 6 is the younger sister of Subject 5. The pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screen for trisomy 18 and SLOS (AFP 0.87 MoM, uE3 0.31 MoM, hCG 0.57 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal female karyotype. She was delivered by Cesarean section at 35 weeks of gestation following an ultrasound that was concerning for IUGR. She had jaundice requiring phototherapy, but her course in the nursery was otherwise uneventful. By age 9 months, developmental delay was apparent and she had developed hypotonia, microcephaly, a mildly myopathic- appearing face and constant involuntary movements with a tendency to hyperextend her arms and close her fists. At 9 1⁄2 months of age, she died unexpectedly in her sleep and the cause of death remains unknown.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
7	7		3-year-old girl, born at term via scheduled Cesarean section, had mild jaundice at birth, prenatal screen showed an increased risk for trisomy 21, noted to have strabismus, hypotonia, athetoid arm and hand movements, clasped hands, and elevated liver transaminases (approximately 3 times upper limit of normal) in infancy, microcephaly was present by age 2 years, severe developmental delay was present but she has shown slow progress without regression, learned to sit alone and started to crawl at 2 years, but had no words.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
8	8		16-year-old girl, older sister of Subject 7, born at term via Cesarean section for decreased fetal movement and bradycardia. Prenatal history was significant for IUGR. Had cyanosis at birth and required resuscitation. Anal stenosis requiring dilatation was noted in the first week of life. Noted to have hypotonia, a movement disorder consisting of head bobbing and extremity athetosis, and developmental delay in early infancy. At 3 years, she could stand unsupported, ambulate with a walker, and started to babble. Seizures developed at age 11 years and she lost all mobility. Other medical history includes acquired microcephaly, an inability to close her eyes completely during sleep, chronic conjunctivitis, corneal clouding, hypolacrima, strabismus, hearing impairment, gastro-esophageal reflux, chronic constipation, severe scoliosis and talipes equinovarus.

Patient 2	2		WES (Baylor College of Medicine Whole Genome Laboratory) revealed a homozygous mutation in exon 9 of the NGLY1 gene denoted as c.1370dupG or p.R458fs. Both parents were confirmed to be heterozygous carriers by Sanger sequencing. The mutation causes a frame shift in codon 458, causing insertion of 13 incorrect residues before a stop codon is introduced towards the end of exon 9. The mutation was not seen in any of 3321 other subjects sequenced at Duke, nor was it seen in 6503 subjects on the Exome Variant Server (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
3	3		WES and whole-genome sequencing were performed using research protocols at Baylor College of Medicine and Stanford University. Mutations in NGLY1 that followed a compound heterozygous inheritance pattern were identified. A stop gain mutation caused by a G>A mutation at position 3:25761670 (hg19) resulting in p.R542X was identified in both the father and daughter. A 3 base pair in-frame deletion TCC> beginning at position 3:25775416 (hg19) was identified in both the mother and daughter. An additional G>T mutation resulting in a heterozygous SMP at position 3:25777564 was identified in the daughter, mother and father. This mutation was not previously observed in 1000 genomes and is a coding region; however, it is present in heterozygous form in all three individuals.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
Patient 4	4		Sanger sequencing (Duke University) detected a homozygous nonsense mutation, p.R401X, at position 3:25775422 (hg19) in transcript ENST00000280700. At the cDNA level this is c.1201A>T in exon 8 of NGLY1. This finding was confirmed in a CLIA- certified laboratory (GeneDx).	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
5	5		The variant in NGLY1, single nucleotide variant T> A at position 3:25775422 (hg19), which was called to be homozygous, was present in the mother’s exome as a heterozygous call. This base pair substitution causes a nonsense mutation, R401X. The NGLY1 variant was independently validated by Sanger sequencing in the patient and both parents.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
6	6		The variant in NGLY1, single nucleotide variant T> A at position 3:25775422 (hg19), which was called to be homozygous, was present in the mother’s exome as a heterozygous call.

7	7		WES detected a homozygous nonsense mutation, R401X, at position 3:25775422 (hg19) in transcript ENST00000280700. At the cDNA level this is c.1201A>T in exon 8 of NGLY1.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
8	8		WES detected a homozygous nonsense mutation, R401X, at position 3:25775422 (hg19) in transcript ENST00000280700. At the cDNA level this is c.1201A>T in exon 8 of NGLY1.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
ALL	ALL		Patients have compound heterozygous knockout mutations in NGLY1. They have a clinical triad consisting of abnormal tear production, choreoathetosis and liver disease. Other common findings include global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, hypotonia, EEG abnormalities with or without overt seizures, brain imaging abnormalities, a peripheral neuropathy, constipation and a history of IUGR. Some patients were noted to have dysmorphic features. Low uE3 was present in three patients, including in two children who died and were found to have significant adrenal cortex vacuolation. Adrenal function was not specifically evaluated in our patients, some degree of dysfunction remains possible.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
ALL	ALL		Patients commonly had abnormalities detected on brain imaging, but findings were typically mild and non-specific. The combination of hypo- or alacrima and a movement disorder consisting of tremulousness and varying degrees of choreoathetosis appear to be pathognomonic for NGLY1 deficiency. Unlike CDGs, NGLY1 deficiency does not appear to be associated with cerebellar atrophy, lipodystrophy, or significant heart manifestations. Lactic acidemia was variably present, but tended to be mild; chronic elevations were not noted in any patient.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt

ALL	ALL		No specific patient information is provided. However, it is mentioned that patients with mutations in MAN1B1, the gene coding for α-1,2-mannosidase, are associated with non-syndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability and subtle dysmorphic features. α-1,2-Mannosidase is a type II transmembrane protein that is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it undergoes O-glycosylation and participates in glycoprotein quality control.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
ALL	ALL	24,25	Patients with autosomal recessive mutations in ERLIN2 present profound intellectual disability, developmental regression and multiple contractures. Abnormal erlin2 causes impaired ERAD of activated inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3) and other substrates by compromising the structure of the erlin1/2 complex. Despite the severity of the intellectual disability and neuromuscular findings, the results of brain imaging, electromyography and muscle biopsy appeared normal in these patients.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
ALL	ALL	26	A family was found to have a homozygous null mutation in ERLIN2, with affected individuals presenting with a hereditary spastic paraplegia phenotype.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
ALL	ALL		NGLY1 deficiency results in accumulation of intact glycoproteins in the cytoplasm. Three patients showed accumulation of an amorphous substance in the liver, and two others showed vacuolization consistent with storage, which may explain the liver disease noted in these patients. The undefined stored substance likely represents accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins in the cytoplasm that have been retrotranslocated from the ER but cannot undergo further processing. Transferrin isoelectric focusing or mass spectrometry studies in NGLY1-deficient patients have been normal or only subtly abnormal.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
ALL	ALL		Patients have axonal loss and gliosis in the brains suggestive of HIE, indicating that NGLY1 plays a role in maintaining central nervous system integrity. They also seem to have peripheral neuropathy that is relatively common in NGLY1 deficiency. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying pathogenesis of both central and peripheral nervous system abnormalities.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt

ALL	ALL		NGLY1 deficiency is characterized by unique features including elevation of AFP and liver enzymes in infancy with relative normalization in early childhood, accumulation of a substance with staining properties similar to glycogen in hepatocyte cytoplasm, absent tears resulting in blepharitis and corneal ulceration, a movement disorder and peripheral neuropathy. The transient nature of the AFP and liver transaminase elevation may make older or more mildly affected individuals difficult to detect.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt
ALL	ALL		12 individuals ages 2 to 21 years with confirmed, biallelic, pathogenic NGLY1 mutations. Clinical features include optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone dystrophy, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, and lower than predicted resting energy expenditure. Laboratory findings include low CSF total protein and albumin, and unusually high antibody titers towards rubella and/or rubeola following vaccination. Confirmed and further quantified previously reported findings noting that decreased tear production, transient transaminitis, small feet, a complex hyperkinetic movement disorder, and varying degrees of global developmental delay with relatively preserved socialization are the most consistent features.

ALL	ALL	NIH Clinical Center	A natural history study of the disorder was initiated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (trial NCT00369421 and trial NCT02089789). This report documents the results of comprehensive, prospective, clinical, molecular, radiologic, and laboratory investigations performed on 12 affected individuals.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Clinical studies were designed to detail the phenotypic features of NGLY1-CDDG. Blood, urine, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), lymphoblasts, and primary dermal fibroblasts were collected, analyzed, and stored. Studies included brain magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI and MRS), routine and overnight electroencephalograms (EEGs) with a limited montage performed during a sleep study, electromyogram (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS), indirect calorimetry, awake and sedated eye examination with Schirmer II testing, optical coherence tomography scans and electroretinography, behavioral determination of pure tone thresholds, tympanometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem evoked potentials (ABR), quantitative sweat analysis autonomic testing (QSWEAT), gastric aspiration, swallow study, skeletal survey, bone age, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), abdominal ultrasound, vibration controlled transient elastography (Fibroscan), echocardiogram, and electrocardiogram. Consultations included clinical neurology, audiology, nutrition, ophthalmology, hepatology, growth, puberty and hormonal studies, allergy and immunology, genetic counseling, physiatry, and speech, occupational, and physical therapy. Eleven individuals underwent developmental psychological evaluations, consisting of at least the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 2nd edition. Cognitive function was assessed with testing specific for age and developmental level that provided either an intelligence quotient (IQ) or developmental quotient (DQ) score. In addition, the Nijmegen pediatric CDG rating scale, a measure of clinical disease progression developed for CDG, was applied to all affected individuals younger than 18 years.

ALL	ALL		Twelve individuals from ten families with confirmed biallelic mutations in NGLY1 were admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. All individuals (six female; six male) were white and ranged from 2.5– 21.3 years of age. We identified 13 different mutations: five missense, five nonsense, two splice site, and one frameshift mutation. The most common mutation was c.1201A>T (p.R401*), occurring in seven alleles. The mutations were widely dispersed along the gene with no obvious hotspot. Only four of the mutations lay within the catalytic domain.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt

ALL	ALL		There was no significant difference in disease severity of males compared to females.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		All twelve subjects had at least some developmental delay or intellectual disability, with a broad range of severity. IQ was below average (n=2) or in the range of intellectual disability (n=9) for the entire group; seven individuals had profound intellectual disability. The two individuals with IQ below average were verbally fluent; the remainder were nonverbal (n=7) or used only single words (n=1) or phrase speech (n=1).	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		On the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition, composite scores ranged from 24 to 98 with a mean of 51 (SEM = 7). There was a consistent profile characterized by relatively strong Socialization scores, followed by Communication, and Daily Living Skills. Motor deficits were also reflected in impaired Daily Living Skills scores. Vineland scores were higher than cognitive scores for all subjects. No cross-sectional relationship between age and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite was found.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		All twelve individuals exhibited hyperkinetic movement disorders that included choreiform, athetoid, dystonic, myoclonic, action tremor, and dysmetric movements and were more severe in the younger individuals.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
SOME	SOME		Seven of twelve subjects had clinical seizures, and one had subclinical seizures recognized on previous EEG. There were no age or genotype differences between individuals having seizures and those without. In each sibling pair, one had seizures and the other did not.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
#6	6		On overnight EEG, only one individual (#6) had active seizures recorded.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt

#11	#11		One teenager had follow-up imaging showed atrophy measurably worse after a 20-month interval (net loss of 34 cm3 relative to expected).	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Increased atrophy correlated with worsening of all functional measurements, including IQ or DQ, Vineland assessments, and Nijmegen scores. Brain volume also directly correlated with CSF levels of 5-HIAA, tetrahydrobiopterin, and 5-HVA.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		N-acetylaspartylglutamate + N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was lower than normal in the left centrum semiovale (LCSO), the midline parietal grey matter (PGM), and superior cerebellar vermis (SVERM). There was a deficit of glutamine + glutamate + gamma-aminobutyric acid (Glx) in the PGM, LCSO, and pons. Choline was higher than expected for age only in the LCSO, and myo-inositol was higher than expected for age in the pons. Multiple correlations between these MRS-measured metabolites and age, functional assessments, brain volume, and neurotransmitters in the CSF were found. The general trend showed that the differences noted above became more pronounced with increasing age, worsening function, and lower brain volume. MRS metabolite measurements did not correlate with total CSF protein, CSF albumin, or CSF/serum albumin ratio. There was a weak correlation between atrophy and total CSF protein, but not CSF albumin or CSF/serum albumin ratio.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Nine subjects underwent lumbar puncture. CSF total protein and albumin concentrations, as well as the CSF/serum albumin ratios, were low in nearly all individuals. There was no correlation between age and CSF protein or albumin levels. CSF 5-HIAA, HVA, and BH4 levels strongly and directly correlated with brain atrophy. CSF lactate and amino acid levels were essentially normal. CSF leucocyte counts (0–4; normal 0–5), glucose concentrations (54–72 mg/dL; normal 40–70), 3-O-methyldopa concentrations (12–28 nM; normal <150) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations (45– 85 nmol/L; normal 40–150) were unremarkable.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
SOME	SOME		In the two oldest subjects, CSF 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were decreased, suggesting neuronal loss.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Neopterin levels were normal but decreased with age, and CSF tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels were below the lower limit of normal in all but one subject tested; however, there was no correlation with age.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Nerve conduction studies were performed in 11 individuals. The predominant finding was an axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (n=8) with additional demyelinative features (n=6). Results of neurophysiological testing demonstrated a length- dependent, progressive loss of sensory and motor axons and sympathetic nerve function, apparently static abnormalities in myelination of peripheral nerves, and possible motor neuron degeneration.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
#6	6		A single individual had a repeat study at one year, showing progression of the neuropathy.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt

ALL	ALL		QSWEATs were performed in 11 individuals, abnormal results were found in 8 individuals who also had axonal sensorimotor neuropathies. The distal lower extremity QSWEAT was more frequently absent (7/11) compared to the forearm (1/11), indicating a length dependent neuropathy. There was a trend to greater severity of neuropathy in the older individuals, with an inverse correlation between tibial motor amplitude and age (p = 0.002, r2 = 0.799); the amplitude decreased by −0.3 mV per year (normal, >+2.5mV per year).	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Awake and sedated ophthalmic examinations were performed on 11 study participants. Observed conditions include Lagophthalmous, ptosis, exotropia and/or esotropia, corneal neovascularization, pannus formation or scarring, optic nerve pallor or atrophy, retinal.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		All individuals had evidence of hypo- or complete alacrima on Schirmer II testing. Tear production did not correlate with age.

PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
SOME	SOME		One participant underwent sedated electroretinography and was diagnosed with cone dystrophy; the photopic responses were reduced to ~50% of the lower limit of normal for age.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Audiologic assessments, including otoacoustic emissions and/or cochlear microphonics to evaluate for the functional integrity of the inner ear, and auditory brainstem response (ABRs), were conducted on 11 subjects. Behavioral hearing thresholds could be established reliably in only three subjects and all had normal hearing sensitivity. Tympanometry was unremarkable. Most remarkable was the dyssynchronous and/or absent transmission through the auditory brainstem and/or 8th nerve in most individuals. The severity of the transmission abnormality through the auditory brainstem increased with increasing age, and the eighth nerve was bilaterally involved the 4 oldest individuals.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Clinical feeding and modified barium swallow assessments were performed on 11 subjects. Oral motor deficits, including persistent nutritive suckle swallow and poor oral bolus formation, were present in 10 of 11. Premature spillage and pharyngeal swallow response delays remained the primary deficits of all subjects. No aspiration or laryngeal penetration for any textures were observed in the swallow studies. Developmental delays in mastication were evident and characterized by munching patterns without matured rotary chewing of solid textures. Generalized weakness of the lips and tongue was observed in all individuals during cranial nerve assessments. Dystonic movements of the tongue and persistent oral reflexes of suckling and suck/swallows were seen in the majority of individuals.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt

ALL	ALL		Seven of 11 individuals tested exhibited out of range elevations in antibody titers towards rubella and/or rubeola following MMR vaccination. Biochemical markers known to be abnormal in mitochondropathies and hypoglycosylation disorders showed inconsistent results.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Bone age was delayed in eight of the 11 subjects tested without any consistent abnormalities of the endocrine system: the somatotropic axis and thyroid function were normal in all studied individuals.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Femoral bone density was low in all nine individuals who underwent DEXA scanning (mean, SEM z-scores for 8 patients < 21 years adjacent to the growth plate = −3, 0.4; metaphysis-diaphysis = −2.2, 0.6, and diaphysis = −1.8, 0.5).	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt

PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Findings noted only once included flexion deformity of the fingers, hallux valgus, sclerotic lesion of the distal femur, thinning of the fibulas, prominent apophyseal bone formation in the ileac crests and ischia, ulnar bowing, expansion of the cortexes in the proximal and middle phalanges in digits 2–4, widened phalanges, and shortened and widened metatarsals.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Our prospective investigations into NGLY1-CDDG revealed several new discoveries associated with this disorder. These included low CSF total protein and albumin, optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone dystrophy, poor weight gain starting in mid- childhood, lower than predicted resting energy expenditure, central and obstructive sleep apnea, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, progressive brain atrophy, abnormalities in brain MRS-measured metabolites, various abnormalities on skeletal survey, high antibody titers after rubella and rubeola vaccination, and low levels of several pro- and anti- coagulation factors. Echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and CSF lactate levels were normal.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Patients showed global developmental delay, movement disorder, frequent seizure disorder, hypotonia, hypolacrima or alacrima, corneal disease, ptosis, lagophthalmous, strabismus, peripheral neuropathy and occasional diminished reflexes, hypohidrosis, auditory brainstem response abnormalities, abnormal brain imaging, scoliosis, acquired microcephaly, small hands and feet, dysmorphic features, constipation, elevated liver enzymes present only early in childhood, osteopenia, and hypocholesterolemia associated with NGLY1-CDDG. Transient elastography results showed minimal if any fibrosis. No abnormal storage material was observed in the three liver biopsy specimens analyzed, nor was ocular apraxia observed, despite performing detailed ophthalmologic evaluations that involved some subjects previously reported to have ocular apraxia.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Patients considered for NGLY1-CDDG differential diagnosis due to the tetrad of developmental delay/intellectual disability, hyperkinetic movement disorder, hypolacrima, and a history of elevated transaminases during early childhood.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Patients have auditory neural pathway dysfunction without peripheral hearing loss, resembling auditory neuropathy. They experience difficulty hearing in the presence of background noise and benefit from quiet listening environments. If hypohidrosis is detected, preventative measures (hydration, ventilation, etc.) against situations that cause dangerous core body hyperthermia can be taken. It is important to aggressively manage hypo-lacrima with artificial tears and bland ointment to prevent secondary complications that can impact vision. They have disordered mastication for solids but a functional ability to swallow, suggesting the need for oral motor and swallowing therapies to facilitate better control and chewing maturation.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Patients have low Motor Skills scores and Daily Living Skills scores due to significant motor involvement required for daily tasks. They have a hyperkinetic movement disorder due to NGLY1-CDDG. This disorder may be caused by myoclonic seizures, neurotransmitter deficiency, and/or peripheral neuropathy manifesting as sensory ataxia.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Results from MRS showed that as functional impairment worsened and age increased, NAA decreased, while choline, myo-inositol and creatine increased. Additionally, creatine and myoinositol were inversely correlated, and NAA directly correlated, with neurotransmitter levels (5-HIAA, 5-HVA, 3-OMD, and neopterin). NAA may be found exclusively in neurons and declines as neurons become unhealthy or die. Elevations in choline could be consistent with a relative abundance of glial cells secondary to neuronal loss. Myo-inositol is a glia-specific marker that is elevated by gliosis or inflammation; in our cohort we do not have any evidence of inflammation. Creatine levels are relatively higher in glial cells compared to neurons. The MRS findings suggest that there is a relative abundance of glial cells compared to neurons in the brain of NGLY1-CDDG individuals, possibly due to loss of neurons, and that the degree of this imbalance contributes significantly to the severity of the phenotype.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Individuals with NGLY1-CDDG share phenotypic features of low cholesterol, hepatopathy, peripheral neuropathy, retinal and optic nerve abnormalities, seizures, developmental delay with socialization as a relative strength, and delayed bone age. They also exhibit hypolacrima, a feature shared with O-linked glycosylation disorders. N-glycanase 1, which catalyzes the cleavage of the amide bond between the proximal N-acetylglucosamine residue of glycans and the asparagine residue of the protein, may be pathogenically related to NGLY1-CDDG. This could impair glycan recycling and lead to hypoglycosylation. Subtle abnormalities in transferrin and ApoC-III glycosylation were observed in these individuals.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		Preliminary experiments found no impairment or enhancement of standard ERAD marker expression under normal conditions in NGLY1-CDDG patient fibroblasts.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		NGLY1-CDDG is a progressive disorder. The Nijmegen severity scores and Vineland scores indicated worsening function with age. Also progressive were the peripheral neuropathy, auditory neural dysfunction, scoliosis, inability to maintain weight, brain atrophy on MRI, abnormalities in brain metabolites measured on MRS, and CSF neurotransmitter levels. Hypolacrima occurred at all ages, and the hepatopathy and hyperkinetic movement disorder appeared to improve with age.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
ALL	ALL		This study reports on several mutations of the NGLY1 gene. The mutations include NM_018297.3:c.931G>A, NM_018297.3:c.1604G>A, NM_018297.3:c.622C>T, NM_018297.3:c.347C>G, NM_018297.3:c.1169G>C, NM_018297.3:c.730T>C, NM_018297.3:c.1910delT, NM_018297.3:c.930C>T, NM_018297.3:c.881+5G>T. Four of these mutations lie within the catalytic domain (amino acid residues 292–353);, i.e., c.730T>C, c.953T>C, c.931G>A, and c.930C> T. The study does not provide specific information about individual patients, their phenotypes, physical or behavioral traits, demographics, lab measurements, treatments, or family histories.

ALL	ALL		Individuals with NGLY1-CDDG have facial features including upturned nasal tip, hypotonic facies, ptosis, brachycephaly, thinned facies, hollowed cheeks, and visible zygomatic arches. Interpupillary distance ranged from the 13–95 centiles with the mean at the 66th centile, and SEM of 8. Horizontal fissure length ranged from 3–70 centiles with mean at the 20th centile, and SEM of 1. Inner canthal distance ranged from 3–100 centiles with the mean at the 59th centile and SEM of 10. Outer canthal distance ranged from 6–81 centile with mean at the 43 centile and SEM of 7. Canthal index ranged from −2 to +2 SD from the normal mean.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
SOME	SOME		Two of eleven individuals showed white matter lesions in their brain MRI findings. One had multiple lesions in the periventricular white matter, some of which were confluent. The other had a single lesion in the periventricular white matter. Both showed cerebral atrophy and slightly prominent sulci. One of them had prominent ventricles.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
