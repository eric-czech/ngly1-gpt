ALL		NGLY1 deficiency is a novel autosomal recessive disorder of the ERAD pathway associated with neurological dysfunction, abnormal tear production, and liver disease. The majority of patients detected to date carry a specific nonsense mutation that appears to be associated with severe disease.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
Patient 1	Need et al.	3-year-old boy with compound heterozygous inactivating mutations in NGLY1. Clinical phenotype suggestive of a congenital disorder of glycosylation, although repeated transferrin isoelectric focusing and N-glycan analyses were normal. Liver biopsy showed accumulation of an amorphous unidentified substance throughout the cytoplasm, a finding likely consistent with NGLY1 dysfunction, which would be expected to result in abnormal accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins because of impaired cytosolic degradation.

Patient 1		5-year-old male, presented in the neonatal period with involuntary movements, including athetosis involving the trunk and extremities and constant lip smacking and pursing while awake. Pregnancy and birth history were unremarkable. He had mild neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy, but otherwise appeared well. Global developmental delay, hypotonia, intractable multifocal epilepsy, consisting of myoclonic seizures, drop attacks, and staring or tonic episodes, and liver disease were present in infancy. He has cortical vision loss and congenital alacrima and corneal ulcerations with scarring were noted at age 4 years. Now, at age 5 years, the movement disorder has not abated and he has central hypotonia and global developmental delay.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
Patient 2		20-year-old female, born at 39 weeks of gestation via Cesarean section due to intrauterine growth retardation and an abnormal appearing placenta. At four months of age, hypotonia, developmental delay and elevated liver transaminases were noted. At approximately 4 years of age, a slight intention tremor and frequent involuntary movements of her neck, hands and arm were observed. At 5 years of age, she was noted to have ocular apraxia, distal tapering of hands and feet, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. She has cortical vision impairment, as well as alacrima and dry eyes that require lubrication, but has not developed corneal scarring. Presently, she has marked intellectual disabilities and requires total care. She has very little expressive speech and communicates through an electronic speech-generating device. She continues to ambulate with a walker.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
Patient 3		4-year-old girl, born via Cesarean section at term for a non-reassuring fetal heart tracing, monitored in the NICU due to poor feeding and lethargy. Pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester screen noting increased risk for Smith-Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and trisomy 18, but karyotype on amniocentesis was normal. As a neonate, she had hyperbilirubinemia treated with phototherapy, elevated liver transaminases and transient thrombocytopenia. In infancy, she had global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, bilateral exotropia, hypotonia, constipation, and intermittent mild lactic acidemia. At age 1 year, she did not make tears when crying, but had adequate tear production to keep her eyes moist. She had intermittent chalazions, but no corneal scarring. She developed staring spells, lasting up to 15 seconds, at approximately age 1 year; these episodes occur about once daily and can be interrupted by gentle contact. By age 17 months she had developed an extrapyramidal movement disorder consisting of asynchronous myoclonic jerks of the limbs and shoulders and subtle choreoathetotic movements of the hands and fingers. At 4 years she can ambulate unassisted, although her gait is unsteady, and communicates with vocalizations, gestures and use of a speech-generating device.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
Patient 4		2-year-old boy, delivered by Cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation after fetal distress was noted on cardiotocography. Pregnancy history was positive for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and oligohydramnios. Had mild hyperbilirubinemia, but otherwise his neonatal course was unremarkable and he was discharged on day of life three. Intermittent head flexion was noted at 6 months, and an EEG at 8 months showed generalized poly-spike discharges. Mild tonic seizures with head and body flexion started soon thereafter, and evolved to single, symmetric spasms with bilateral arm extension. Involuntary movements of the upper extremities were also noted at this time. In addition, global developmental delay, bilateral ptosis, abnormal tear production, elevated liver transaminases (3 to 4 times upper limit of normal), and constipation were noted in infancy. He has had recurrent episodes of keratoconjunctivitis and poor lid closure during sleep with resultant corneal scarring.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
Patient 5		A boy who died at the age of 5 years, was born at term following a pregnancy that was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screening for trisomy 18 and Smith- Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) (AFP 1.97 MoM, uE3 0.24 MoM and hCG 0.48 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal male karyotype and measurement of 7-dehydrocholesterol in amniotic fluid excluded SLOS. He was delivered by Cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation due to concerns for IUGR and a non-reassuring stress test. He had mild flexion contractures of both knees, but had an uneventful neonatal period. He had global developmental delay and constant movements of his arms and legs since early infancy and developed head bobbing at 7 months. At 8 months, liver transaminase elevations (approximately 1.5 times the upper limit of normal) were noted, and the elevations persisted until age 3 1⁄2 years. His reflexes appeared normal in infancy, but were diminished by age 2 years and at 38 months could no longer be elicited. During the second year of life, he was noted to have dry eyes that were treated with lubricant drops at bedtime, and microcephaly was present by 16 months. At 2 1⁄2 years, he developed myoclonic seizures that became intractable despite numerous therapeutic trials. Between the ages of 10 months and five years, he showed slow developmental progress, but regressed during the last year. He died at age 5 years following a viral illness and a prolonged seizure.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
Patient 6		Younger sister of Subject 5. Pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screen for trisomy 18 and SLOS (AFP 0.87 MoM, uE3 0.31 MoM, hCG 0.57 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal female karyotype. Delivered by Cesarean section at 35 weeks of gestation following an ultrasound that was concerning for IUGR. Had jaundice requiring phototherapy, but her course in the nursery was otherwise uneventful. By age 9 months, developmental delay was apparent and she had developed hypotonia, microcephaly, a mildly myopathic- appearing face and constant involuntary movements with a tendency to hyperextend her arms and close her fists. At 9 1⁄2 months of age, she died unexpectedly in her sleep and the cause of death remains unknown.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
Patient 7		3-year-old girl, born at term via scheduled Cesarean section, had mild jaundice at birth, prenatal screen showed an increased risk for trisomy 21. In infancy, she had strabismus, hypotonia, athetoid arm and hand movements, clasped hands, and elevated liver transaminases (approximately 3 times upper limit of normal). Microcephaly was present by age 2 years. Severe developmental delay was present, but she has shown slow progress without regression. She learned to sit alone and started to crawl at 2 years, but had no words.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
Patient 8		16-year-old girl, older sister of Subject 7, born at term via Cesarean section for decreased fetal movement and bradycardia. Prenatal history was significant for IUGR. Had cyanosis at birth and required resuscitation. Anal stenosis requiring dilatation was noted in the first week of life. Noted to have hypotonia, a movement disorder consisting of head bobbing and extremity athetosis, and developmental delay in early infancy. At 3 years, she could stand unsupported, ambulate with a walker, and started to babble. Seizures developed at age 11 years and she lost all mobility. Other medical history includes acquired microcephaly, an inability to close her eyes completely during sleep, chronic conjunctivitis, corneal clouding, hypolacrima, strabismus, hearing impairment, gastro-esophageal reflux, chronic constipation, severe scoliosis and talipes equinovarus.

Patient 2		WES (Baylor College of Medicine Whole Genome Laboratory) revealed a homozygous mutation in exon 9 of the NGLY1 gene denoted as c.1370dupG or p.R458fs. Both parents were confirmed to be heterozygous carriers by Sanger sequencing. The mutation causes a frame shift in codon 458, causing insertion of 13 incorrect residues before a stop codon is introduced towards the end of exon 9. The mutation was not seen in any of 3321 other subjects sequenced at Duke, nor was it seen in 6503 subjects on the Exome Variant Server (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA.

Patient 3		WES and whole-genome sequencing were performed using research protocols at Baylor College of Medicine and Stanford University. Mutations in NGLY1 that followed a compound heterozygous inheritance pattern were identified. A stop gain mutation caused by a G>A mutation at position 3:25761670 (hg19) resulting in p.R542X was identified in both the father and daughter. A 3 base pair in-frame deletion TCC> beginning at position 3:25775416 (hg19) was identified in both the mother and daughter. An additional G>T mutation resulting in a heterozygous SMP at position 3:25777564 was identified in the daughter, mother and father.

ALL		Patients have compound heterozygous knockout mutations in NGLY1, confirming NGLY1 deficiency as an inherited disorder of the ERAD pathway. Patients have a clinical triad consisting of abnormal tear production, choreoathetosis and liver disease. Other common findings include global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, hypotonia, EEG abnormalities with or without overt seizures, brain imaging abnormalities, a peripheral neuropathy, constipation and a history of IUGR. Some patients were noted to have dysmorphic features. Low uE3 was present in three patients, including in two children who died and were found to have significant adrenal cortex vacuolation. Adrenal function was not specifically evaluated in our patients, but some degree of dysfunction remains possible.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
ALL		Patients commonly had abnormalities detected on brain imaging, but findings were typically mild and non-specific. The combination of hypo- or alacrima and a movement disorder consisting of tremulousness and varying degrees of choreoathetosis appear to be pathognomonic for NGLY1 deficiency. Unlike CDGs, NGLY1 deficiency does not appear to be associated with cerebellar atrophy, lipodystrophy, or significant heart manifestations.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
ALL		Lactic acidemia was variably present, but tended to be mild; chronic elevations were not noted in any patient.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
Patient 3		A moderate reduction in mitochondrial DNA content was identified in a liver sample.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
Patients 5 and 6		Significant brain disease was noted on autopsy. They were found to have pathological changes consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Neuronal loss and gliosis may occur in both HIE and mitochondrial disorders, but spongiform degeneration is more typically seen in the latter and was not present in our cases.

			PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	ALL,24,Patients with autosomal recessive mutations in ERLIN2 present profound intellectual disability, developmental regression and multiple contractures. Despite the severity of the intellectual disability and neuromuscular findings, the results of brain imaging, electromyography and muscle biopsy appeared normal in the initial erlin2-deficient patients.
			PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	ALL,26,Another family was found to have a homozygous null mutation in ERLIN2, with affected individuals presenting with a hereditary spastic paraplegia phenotype.
ALL		The patients have NGLY1 deficiency which results in accumulation of intact glycoproteins in the cytoplasm. This is evidenced by the accumulation of an amorphous substance in the liver of three patients, and the vacuolization consistent with storage in two others. These findings may explain the liver disease noted in the patients. Transferrin isoelectric focusing or mass spectrometry studies in the patients have been normal or only subtly abnormal.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
ALL		Patients have axonal loss and gliosis in the brains suggestive of HIE, indicating that NGLY1 plays a role in maintaining central nervous system integrity. They also seem to have peripheral neuropathy that is relatively common in NGLY1 deficiency. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying pathogenesis of both central and peripheral nervous system abnormalities.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt

ALL		NGLY1 deficiency is characterized by unique features including elevation of AFP and liver enzymes in infancy with relative normalization in early childhood, accumulation of a substance with staining properties similar to glycogen in hepatocyte cytoplasm, absent tears resulting in blepharitis and corneal ulceration, a movement disorder and peripheral neuropathy. The transient nature of the AFP and liver transaminase elevation may make older or more mildly affected individuals difficult to detect.	PMC4243708	PMC4243708.txt	
ALL		12 individuals ages 2 to 21 years with confirmed, biallelic, pathogenic NGLY1 mutations. Clinical features include optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone dystrophy, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, and lower than predicted resting energy expenditure. Laboratory findings include low CSF total protein and albumin, and unusually high antibody titers towards rubella and/or rubeola following vaccination. Confirmed and further quantified previously reported findings noting that decreased tear production, transient transaminitis, small feet, a complex hyperkinetic movement disorder, and varying degrees of global developmental delay with relatively preserved socialization are the most consistent features.

There was a deficit of glutamine + glutamate + gamma-aminobutyric acid (Glx) in the PGM (p=0.03), LCSO (p=0.01), and pons (p=0.0002). Choline was higher than expected for age only in the LCSO (p=0.0097), and myo-inositol was higher than expected for age in the pons (p=0.002). Multiple correlations between these MRS-measured metabolites and age, functional assessments, brain volume, and neurotransmitters in the CSF were found. The general trend showed that the differences noted above became more pronounced with increasing age, worsening function, and lower brain volume. MRS metabolite measurements did not correlate with total CSF protein, CSF albumin, or CSF/serum albumin ratio. There was a weak correlation (p=0.09) between atrophy and total CSF protein, but not CSF albumin or CSF/serum albumin ratio.
ALL		Nine subjects underwent lumbar puncture. CSF total protein and albumin concentrations, as well as the CSF/serum albumin ratios, were low in nearly all individuals. There was no correlation between age and CSF protein or albumin levels. In the two oldest subjects, CSF 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were decreased, suggesting neuronal loss. Neopterin levels were normal but decreased with age, and CSF tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels were below the lower limit of normal in all but one subject tested; however, there was no correlation with age. CSF 5-HIAA, HVA, and BH4 levels strongly and directly correlated with brain atrophy. CSF lactate and amino acid levels were essentially normal. CSF leucocyte counts (0–4; normal 0–5), glucose concentrations (54–72 mg/dL; normal 40–70), 3-O-methyldopa concentrations (12–28 nM; normal <150) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations (45– 85 nmol/L; normal 40–150) were unremarkable.

These included low CSF total protein and albumin, optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone dystrophy, poor weight gain starting in mid- childhood, lower than predicted resting energy expenditure, central and obstructive sleep apnea, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, progressive brain atrophy, abnormalities in brain MRS-measured metabolites, various abnormalities on skeletal survey, high antibody titers after rubella and rubeola vaccination, and low levels of several pro- and anti- coagulation factors. Echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and CSF lactate levels were normal.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	
ALL		Patients showed global developmental delay, movement disorder, frequent seizure disorder, hypotonia, hypolacrima or alacrima, corneal disease, ptosis, lagophthalmous, strabismus, peripheral neuropathy and occasional diminished reflexes, hypohidrosis, auditory brainstem response abnormalities, abnormal brain imaging, scoliosis, acquired microcephaly, small hands and feet, dysmorphic features, constipation, elevated liver enzymes present only early in childhood, osteopenia, and hypocholesterolemia associated with NGLY1-CDDG. Transient elastography results showed minimal if any fibrosis. No abnormal storage material was observed in the three liver biopsy specimens analyzed. No ocular apraxia was observed despite performing detailed ophthalmologic evaluations.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	
ALL		Patients considered for NGLY1-CDDG differential diagnosis due to the tetrad of developmental delay/intellectual disability, hyperkinetic movement disorder, hypolacrima, and a history of elevated transaminases during early childhood.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	
ALL		Patients have auditory neural pathway dysfunction without peripheral hearing loss, resembling auditory neuropathy. They experience difficulty hearing in the presence of background noise and benefit from quiet listening environments.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	
ALL		If hypohidrosis is detected in patients, preventative measures such as hydration and ventilation can be taken against situations that cause dangerous core body hyperthermia.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	
ALL		It is important to aggressively manage hypo-lacrima in patients with artificial tears and bland ointment to prevent secondary complications that can impact vision.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	
ALL		Patients have disordered mastication for solids but a functional ability to swallow, suggesting the need for oral motor and swallowing therapies to facilitate better control and chewing maturation.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	
ALL		Patients have low Motor Skills scores and Daily Living Skills scores, indicating significant motor involvement required for daily tasks. They have a hyperkinetic movement disorder associated with NGLY1-CDDG. Potential contributors to this movement disorder include myoclonic seizures, neurotransmitter deficiency, and/or peripheral neuropathy manifesting as sensory ataxia.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	
			PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	ALL,NA,Strong correlation between brain atrophy on MRI and functional assessments suggests that loss of neurons contributes to the functional impairment. The atrophy also correlated with CSF metabolites (BH4, 5-HIAA, HVA), which are known to be lower when there is damage to neurotransmitter producing neurons. This suggests that these biochemical abnormalities may be secondary to brain atrophy.
ALL		Results from MRS showed that as functional impairment worsened and age increased, NAA decreased, while choline, myo-inositol and creatine increased. Creatine and myoinositol were inversely correlated, and NAA directly correlated, with neurotransmitter levels (5-HIAA, 5-HVA, 3-OMD, and neopterin). There is a relative abundance of glial cells compared to neurons in the brain of NGLY1-CDDG individuals, possibly due to loss of neurons, and that the degree of this imbalance contributes significantly to the severity of the phenotype.

ALL		Patients have impaired sweat response, largely affecting distal responses, consistent with a small fiber neuropathy. No significant change in the QAlb ratio, arguing against increased turnover as a possible etiology. Decreased CSF protein and albumin concentrations represent a novel diagnostic marker for this disorder.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	
ALL		Individuals with NGLY1-CDDG share phenotypic features of low cholesterol, hepatopathy, peripheral neuropathy, retinal and optic nerve abnormalities, seizures, developmental delay with socialization as a relative strength, and delayed bone age. They also exhibit hypolacrima, a feature shared with O-linked glycosylation disorders. N-glycanase 1, which is impaired in NGLY1-CDDG, catalyzes the cleavage of the amide bond between the proximal N-acetylglucosamine residue of glycans and the asparagine residue of the protein, potentially leading to hypoglycosylation. Subtle abnormalities in transferrin and ApoC-III glycosylation were observed in these individuals.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	
ALL		Preliminary experiments found no impairment or enhancement of standard ERAD marker expression under normal conditions in NGLY1-CDDG patient fibroblasts.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	
ALL		NGLY1-CDDG is a progressive disorder. The Nijmegen severity scores and Vineland scores indicated worsening function with age. Also progressive were the peripheral neuropathy, auditory neural dysfunction, scoliosis, inability to maintain weight, brain atrophy on MRI, abnormalities in brain metabolites measured on MRS, and CSF neurotransmitter levels. Hypolacrima occurred at all ages, and the hepatopathy and hyperkinetic movement disorder appeared to improve with age.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt

ALL		Individuals with NGLY1-CDDG have facial features that include upturned nasal tip, hypotonic facies, ptosis, brachycephaly, thinned facies, hollowed cheeks, and visible zygomatic arches. Interpupillary distance ranged from the 13–95 centiles with the mean at the 66th centile, and SEM of 8. Horizontal fissure length ranged from 3–70 centiles with mean at the 20th centile, and SEM of 1. Inner canthal distance ranged from 3–100 centiles with the mean at the 59th centile and SEM of 10. Outer canthal distance ranged from 6–81 centile with mean at the 43 centile and SEM of 7. Canthal index ranged from −2 to +2 SD from the normal mean.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt	
SOME		Two of eleven individuals showed white matter lesions in their brain MRI findings. One had multiple lesions in the periventricular white matter, some of which were confluent. The other had a single lesion in the periventricular white matter. Both showed cerebral atrophy and slightly prominent sulci. One of them had prominent ventricles.	PMC7477955	PMC7477955.txt
