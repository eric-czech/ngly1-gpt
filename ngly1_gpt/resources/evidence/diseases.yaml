      Pathogenesis
      Upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in RA synovium and synovial fluid is a feature of active disease and intense inflammation. Antiinflammatory mediators are also present and activated in RA but fail to counterregulate the proinflammatory cytokines. Muller-Ladner et al. (2000) found that the IL4-STAT (STAT6; 601512) pathway is activated in patients with short-term (less than 1 year) and long-term (more than 2 years) RA and may contribute to downregulation of the immunologic activity in RA synovium. 

      In a T-cell receptor transgenic mouse model, an inflammatory arthritis that resembles human RA is initiated by T cells but is sustained by antibodies to GPI (172400). Using ELISA analysis, Schaller et al. (2001) detected high levels of antibody to GPI, independent of the presence of rheumatoid factor, in serum and synovial fluid of most RA patients; antibodies to GPI were rare in controls or in patients with Lyme arthritis or Sjogren syndrome. 
      
      In addition, the authors found high levels of GPI in sera and synovial fluid and the presence of GPI-containing immune complexes in RA synovial fluid. Immunohistochemical analysis and confocal microscopy demonstrated intense expression of GPI on the surface of endothelial cells of synovial arterioles and some capillaries, but not venules or in other tissues. Intense patchy expression was observed on the surface lining of hypertrophic synovium, particularly where the hypertrophic villus formed; this expression pattern resembled that for vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF; 192240). Schaller et al. (2001) suggested that GPI may be presented to the immune system either on endothelial cell surfaces or as a soluble protein in synovial fluid of inflamed RA joints, leading to antibody binding or to immune complex formation with complement activation, respectively. In either case, they concluded that there is a role for autoantibody in the pathology of RA and that there may be scope for antibody treatments for the disease. 

      Using a rheumatoid factor (RF+) transgenic B cell hybridoma line originally isolated from an autoimmune MRL/lpr mouse used as a model for SLE, Leadbetter et al. (2002) determined that these cells respond only to IgG2a immune complexes containing DNA and not to haptens or proteins. After ruling out complement receptors (i.e., CD21/CR2, 120650) as a potential second receptor on B cells, screening of cells expressing the adaptor protein Myd88 (602170), through which all toll-like receptors signal, revealed that RF+ B cells lacking Myd88 are completely unresponsive to IgG2a antinucleosome monoclonal antibodies (mAb). TLR9 (605474) responsiveness to CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) is presumed to require endosome acidification. The response to stimulation of RF+ B cells by IgG2a mAb or CpG-ODN, but not by TLR2 (603028) or TLR4 (603030) agonists, was blocked by inhibitors of endosome acidification, notably chloroquine, suggesting a mechanistic basis for its efficacy in the treatment for both RA and SLE. Leadbetter et al. (2002) proposed that other endogenous subcellular nucleic acid-protein autoantigens may signal through other TLRs to abrogate peripheral B-cell tolerance. They also suggested that infectious agent PAMP (patterns associated with microbial pathogens) engaging TLRs may create a synergy with autoantibody-autoantigen immune complexes, thus explaining the association between infection and autoimmune disease flares. 

      Nedvetzki et al. (2003) identified a CD44 variant (107269), designated CD44vRA, in synovial fluid aspirated from 23 of 30 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Functional expression studies in human cells showed that the CD44vRA variant interacted with FGF2 (134920) via the heparan sulfate on exon v3 in a way that enhanced binding and activation of soluble FGFR1 (136350) to a greater extent than CD44v3-v10. Synovial fluid cells from RA patients bound soluble FGFR1 more intensively than control cells. Nedvetzki et al. (2003) postulated that activation of FGFR1 may play a role in the RA inflammatory process. 

      Seyler et al. (2005) analyzed synovial tissue specimens from 72 patients with RA for TNFSF13 (604472) and TNFSF13B (603969) production and TNFSF13/TNFSF13B receptor expression. In synovitis with ectopic germinal centers present, inhibiting TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B with a TACI (TNFRSF13B; 604907):Fc fusion protein resulted in destruction of the germinal centers and marked inhibition of IFN-gamma (147570) and Ig transcription, whereas similar inhibition in the aggregate and diffuse types of synovitis enhanced IFN-gamma production and did not affect Ig levels. These differential immunomodulatory effects correlated with the presence of TACI-positive T cells in aggregate and diffuse synovitis and their absence in synovitis with germinal centers. Seyler et al. (2005) proposed that TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B regulate B-cell as well as T-cell function and have both pro- and antiinflammatory effects in RA. 

      Boilard et al. (2010) investigated the role of platelets in rheumatoid arthritis. Boilard et al. (2010) identified platelet microparticles--submicrometer vesicles elaborated by activated platelets--in joint fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of inflammatory arthritis, but not in joint fluids from patients with osteoarthritis. Platelet microparticles were proinflammatory, eliciting cytokine responses from synovial fibroblasts via interleukin-1 (see 147760). Consistent with these findings, depletion of platelets attenuated murine inflammatory arthritis. Using both pharmacologic and genetic approaches, Boilard et al. (2010) identified the collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GP6; 605546) as a key trigger for platelet microparticle generation in arthritis pathophysiology. Boilard et al. (2010) concluded that their findings demonstrated a previously unappreciated role for platelets and their activation-induced microparticles in inflammatory joint diseases. 

      Raj et al. (2014) performed an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study of purified CD4 (186940)+ T cells and monocytes, representing adaptive and innate immunity, in a multiethnic cohort of 461 healthy individuals. Context-specific cis- and trans-eQTLs were identified, and cross-population mapping allowed, in some cases, putative functional assignment of candidate causal regulatory variants for disease-associated loci. Raj et al. (2014) noted an overrepresentation of T cell-specific eQTLs among susceptibility alleles for autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (126200), and of monocyte-specific eQTLs among Alzheimer disease (104300) and Parkinson disease (168600) variants. Raj et al. (2014) concluded that this polarization implicates specific immune cell types in these diseases and points to the need to identify the cell-autonomous effects of disease susceptibility variants. 

      Ito et al. (2014) isolated arthritogenic T-cell receptors (TCRs) from mice engineered to generate T cells mediating autoimmune arthritis, which resembles human RA, and characterized the self antigens that they recognized. One of them was the ubiquitously expressed 60S ribosomal protein L23A (RPL23A; 602326), with which T cells and autoantibodies from RA patients reacted.

      Molecular Genetics
      Because mutations in the NOD2/CARD15 gene had been found in Crohn disease (266600), a disorder characterized by episodic intestinal inflammation with epithelioid granulomas, and because CARD15 is expressed predominantly in monocytes, a cell type that can differentiate into giant and epithelioid cells aggregating in granuloma formations, Miceli-Richard et al. (2001) did a mutation screen of 4 families with Blau syndrome and identified 3 different missense mutations in the CARD15 gene (605956.0004-605956.0006). One of the families had been reported by Manouvrier-Hanu et al. (1998). In a 27-year-old Japanese man with systemic granulomatous disease, in whom lack of a family history of the disease led to a diagnosis of 'early-onset sarcoidosis' rather than Blau syndrome, Kanazawa et al. (2004) identified 1 of the same CARD15 mutations (R334W; 605056.0006) that had previously been detected in Blau syndrome. 

      Kanazawa et al. (2005) retrospectively collected Japanese 'early-onset sarcoidosis' cases in search of CARD15 mutations. Among 10 EOS cases, missense mutations were identified in 9: 4 patients, including a patient originally reported by Sakurai et al. (1997) and the 27-year-old man previously studied by Kanazawa et al. (2004), were heterozygous for the R334W mutation that had been reported in patients diagnosed with Blau syndrome; and 4 patients, including a 32-year-old woman originally diagnosed with 'ocular sarcoidosis' by Shimomura et al. (1982), carried different novel missense mutations (see, e.g., 605956.0008). In addition, a 16-year-old girl who was reported by Ukae et al. (1994) to have 'preschool sarcoidosis' was found to have 2 missense mutations (D382E, 605956.0009 and A612T, 605956.0010). (The pathogenicity of the A612T variant was later called into question.) All of these variants of CARD15 showed increased basal NFKB activity. Kanazawa et al. (2005) concluded that most patients given a diagnosis of early-onset sarcoidosis or Blau syndrome share a common genetic etiology of CARD15 mutations that cause constitutive NFKB activation, and noted that this supported the long-standing hypothesis that sporadic cases of EOS and familial cases of Blau syndrome represent different types of the same juvenile systemic granulomatosis syndrome. 

      In a 63-year-old man who exhibited features of Blau syndrome and also had severe camptodactyly and recalcitrant leg ulcers, Dhondt et al. (2008) sequenced the candidate gene NOD2 and identified heterozygosity for the R334W mutation. In a 9-month-old Caucasian boy with Blau syndrome, who also exhibited gastrointestinal granulomas, Borzutzky et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for the IVS8+158 variant (605056.0007) in the NOD2 gene.

      Clinical description
      Skin rash (of tiny red/tan dots) is usually the first manifestation and appears as early as the age of 1 month on the face and then spreads to the trunk. Patients can have intermittent episodes of skin lesions that resolve without treatment. Joint manifestations usually begin before the age of 10 with painless cyst-like swellings on the back of feet and wrists. Symmetric arthritis (with boggy inflammatory synovitis and tenosynovitis) of the wrists, ankles, knees and sometimes elbows follows. Camptodactyly due to hypertrophic tenosynovitis is often described as the disease progresses. Severe handicap is not usually experienced until the age of 40-50. An insidious granulomatous iridocyclitis and posterior uveitis (see this term) can evolve into a severe destructive panuveitis. Over time, characteristic iris nodules, focal synechiae, cataract, increased intraocular pressure and characteristic clumpy keratic precipitates at the limbus ensue. Posterior involvement includes vitritis, multifocal choroiditis, retinal vasculopathy and optic nerve edema. Significant visual loss is observed in 20-30% of the affected individuals. The spectrum of clinical manifestations includes fever, malignant systemic and pulmonary hypertension, granulomatous large-vessel vasculitis and granulomatous inflammation of the liver, kidneys and lung.

      Etiology
      BS is due to an inherited or de novo mutation in the NOD2 gene (16q12), responsible for alterations in the innate immune response, inflammation and cell death. From transfection studies, it has been proposed that NOD2 mutations cause activation of nuclear factor kappa B which is in turn an up-regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription.

      Diagnostic methods
      Diagnosis relies greatly on the demonstration of noncaseating granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells on a skin, synovial or conjunctival biopsy, and genetic testing for mutations in the NOD2 gene.

      Clinical description
      Disease onset typically occurs within the first hours/days of life with an urticarial rash, persistent elevation of acute phase reactants, and intermittent fever (which may be low-grade or absent). Typical facial features include frontal bossing and saddle back nose. The rash is typically non-pruritic and changes distribution during the day, without vasculitic alterations. Central nervous system manifestations include chronic aseptic meningitis, which, if left untreated, leads to brain atrophy, severe intellectual disability and sensorineural hearing loss. Typical neurological symptoms include chronic irritability, headache, early morning nausea, vomiting and, rarely, seizures. Ocular manifestations may include conjunctivitis, papilledema, optic nerve atrophy and progressive vision loss. Early degenerative arthropathy frequently involves large joints and causes deformities and contractures.

      Etiology
      Mutations (usually de novo ) in the NLRP3 gene (chromosome 1q44) are identified in the majority of patients; however 30-35% of affected individuals lack a detectable mutation. Most of these patients display a somatic mosaicism for NLRP3. The NLRP3 gene plays a key role in innate immunity, encoding a component of the NLRP3-inflammasome, with gain of function mutations leading to overproduction of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta).

      Diagnostic methods
      The general consensus is that the clinical picture of CINCA is sufficient for diagnosis. Laboratory analyses document a nonspecific inflammatory syndrome with anemia, granulocyte hyperleukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and elevated concentrations of C reactive protein. No autoantibodies or immune deficiencies are detected. Skin biopsy shows a neutrophilc dermatosis with massive perivascular neutrophil infiltration without signs of vasculitis. Brain MRI shows evident signs of meningitis with a possible inflammatory involvement of the inner ear. Ophtalmological examination may reveal palilledema. Genetic testing usually detects de-novo NLRP3 mutations are detected but is not obligatory for diagnosis. In the absence of a positive standard genetic test, NLRP3 somatic mosaism should be investigated

      Clinical Features
      CINCA syndrome, also known as 'neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease,' or NOMID, is a rare congenital inflammatory disorder characterized by a triad of neonatal onset of cutaneous symptoms, chronic meningitis, and joint manifestations with recurrent fever and inflammation (Prieur and Griscelli, 1981; Hassink and Goldsmith, 1983; Torbiak et al., 1989; Prieur, 2001). Persistent and migratory skin rash associated with skin perivascular polymorphonuclear infiltrates is present in patients, starting at birth. A progressive neurologic impairment results from chronic meningitis caused by polymorphonuclear cell infiltration. A progressive visual defect and perceptive deafness frequently occur with increasing age. Joint symptoms manifest recurrent joint flares with or without severe radiologically evident modifications involving the growth cartilage or bone epiphysis. Distinctive facies with characteristic frontal bossing and protruding eyes have been described, as well as shortening of distal limbs and growth retardation, giving a sib-like resemblance between unrelated patients. Intrafamilial occurrence, although much rarer than sporadic cases, is suggestive of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (Feldmann et al., 2002). 

      Overgrowth of the patella and distal femur create a prominence of the knees that is characteristic of CINCA syndrome. This particular feature was noted in the report of Prieur and Griscelli (1981) and the review of Prieur et al. (1987) with clinical photographs and radiographs. Prieur et al. (1987) reported on the clinical presentation and course of 30 patients with CINCA syndrome observed in France, Germany, Finland, England, and the United States. Leone et al. (2003) studied 3 patients with CINCA syndrome and found that all showed normal phagocytosis and oxidative burst functions of neutrophils. Because the patients had significantly increased expression of CD10 (120520), Leone et al. (2003) postulated that this finding may be a useful marker of the inflammatory disorder typical of some patients.

      Molecular Genetics
      Feldmann et al. (2002) identified heterozygous missense mutations in exon 3 of the CIAS1 gene (e.g., 606416.0007) in the affected members of each of 7 families with CINCA syndrome. Of 3 patients with CINCA syndrome studied by Leone et al. (2003), only 1 had a mutation in exon 3 of the CIAS1 gene. Aksentijevich et al. (2002) identified heterozygous missense mutations in exon 3 of the CIAS1 gene in 6 of 13 patients with CINCA syndrome. No mutation in the CIAS1 gene was found in the other 7 patients, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. Aksentijevich et al. (2002) found no discernible differences in the clinical features of patients with or without mutations in CIAS1.

      Pathogenesis
      Babior and Matzner (1997) suggested that the pathogenesis of FMF is as follows: pyrin, or marenostrin, is postulated to activate the biosynthesis of a chemotactic factor inactivator, an enzyme that normally occurs in the serosal fluids. They suggested that a chemotactic factor (probably C5a; 113995) can be released by subclinical injury to the serosa during normal activities, but the amounts released are small enough that they are cleared by the inactivating enzyme before they can provoke an inflammatory reaction. In FMF the inactivating enzyme is absent, allowing the chemotactic factors to survive long enough to call in neutrophils, which then release a variety of products, including an enzyme that generates more C5a. The result is an upward spiral that culminates in a full-blown inflammatory reaction: an attack of FMF. 
    orphanet: |
      Clinical description
      Disease onset usually occurs before the age of 30 with an earlier onset corresponding to a more severe phenotype. FMF can be divided into 2 types: FMF type 1 and 2. Type 1 is characterized by attacks (as often as once a week or every few years) of fever and serositis lasting 1-4 days and resolving spontaneously. Stress, exposure to cold, fat-rich meals, infections, certain drugs and menstrual cycles are possible attack triggers. Mild symptoms (myalgia, headache, nausea, dyspnea, arthralgia, low back pain, asthenia and anxiety) precede attacks and last about 17 hours. Attacks manifest as fever (38°C-40°C lasting 12-72 hours and not responding to antibiotics), diffuse or localized abdominal pain (often mimicking acute abdomen), constipation (diarrhea in children), arthralgias (in large joints), arthritis (in upper/lower limb/knee joints) and chest pain caused by pleuritis and/or pericarditis (see this term). In 7-40% of patients cutaneous involvement is also present. Amyloidosis type AA (see this term) can be a serious long term complication. FMF type 2 describes a phenotype where amyloidosis occurs as the first and only manifestation of the disease.

      Etiology
      To date, 218 mutations in the MEFV gene on chromosome 16 encoding the pyrin/marenostrin protein are responsible for the phenotypic variance (M694V homozygous mutations are associated with increased severity) seen in the disease. As not all patients have a mutation in the MEFV gene, other factors may be involved.

      Diagnostic methods
      The Tel-Hashomer criteria states that 2 major criteria (fever and serositis, amyloidosis AA, effectiveness of colchicine) or 1 major and 2 minor criteria (recurrent attacks of fever, erysipela-like erythema, relatives affected by FMF) must be present for diagnosis. Genetic testing only has a 70-80 % positive predictive value.

      Clinical description
      The first affected family contained ten affected members from three generations and manifested variable expression of a pauciarticular, nonaxial, arthritis that began in childhood; pyoderma gangrenosum; and severe cystic acne in adolescence and beyond. PAPA syndrome is a self-limiting disease, but it can lead to severe joint destruction. Synovial fluid is purulent with neutrophil accumulation, but cultures are invariably negative. Recurrent sterile arthritis usually occurs after minor trauma, but can also occur spontaneously. Other less commonly associated features include adult-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, proteinuria, and abscess formation at the site of parenteral injections (pathergy).

      Etiology
      The gene responsible for the syndrome, the proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) gene (previously known as the CD2 binding protein 1 (CD2BP1) gene), was cloned in 2002. Only two mutations account for the known cases. Recently, the PSTPIP1 protein has been demonstrated to bind pyrin/marenostrin (P/M), the protein encoded by the MEFV gene, mutations in which cause Familial Mediterranean Fever. PAPA-associated PSTPIP1 mutants exhibit increased binding to P/M.

      Clinical Features
      Lindor et al. (1997) described a multigeneration family with transmission of an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and severe cystic acne. Ten affected family members manifested variable expression of pauciarticular, nonaxial, destructive, corticosteroid-responsive arthritis that began in childhood; pyoderma gangrenosum; and severe cystic acne in adolescence and beyond. Other less commonly associated features included adult-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, proteinuria, abscess formation at the site of parenteral injections, and cytopenias attributable to sulfonamide medications. Genetic studies excluded linkage to the major histocompatibility complex

      Molecular Genetics
      Wise et al. (2002) identified missense mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene (606347) gene in 2 reported families with this disorder. PSTPIP1 and its murine ortholog are adaptor proteins known to interact with PEST-type PTPs such as PTPN12 (600079). Yeast 2-hybrid assays demonstrated severely reduced binding between PTPN12 and the E250Q (606347.0001) and A230T (606347.0002) mutant proteins of PSTPIP1. Previous evidence supported the integral role of CD2BP1 (alternative symbol for PSTPIP1) and its interacting proteins in actin reorganization during cytoskeletal-mediated events. The authors hypothesized that the disease-causing mutations identified compromise physiologic signaling necessary for the maintenance of a proper inflammatory response.

      Clinical description
      Classical clinical presentation is in childhood when xanthomas are first noted on extremities, trunk and in extensor tendons. Patients may also have corneal arcus, xanthelasmas, arterial bruits, cardiac ejection murmurs and diminished peripheral arterial pulses. A lipid profile demonstrates profoundly elevated levels of total and LDL cholesterol.

      Etiology
      The core molecular defect involves loss of function of the LDL receptor on hepatocytes due to bi-allelic pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene in 80-90% of cases. There are >3000 reported pathogenic variants in LDLR. Clinical severity varies in relation to the extent of functional impairment imparted by the particular variant. A similar phenotype can result from bi-allelic binding-defective variants in APOB which encodes apolipoprotein B, the ligand for the LDL receptor. About 1-2% of cases result from bi-allelic gain-of-function variants in PCSK9 which encodes proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9. A true recessive phenotype results from bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in LDLRAP1 encoding the LDL receptor adaptor protein. Even rarer variants in other genes can sometimes produce a phenotype that resembles HoFH.

      Diagnostic methods
      Diagnosis is made based on clinical features, the degree of LDL cholesterol elevation, family history, plus DNA sequencing for a definitive diagnosis.
    omim: |
      Pathogenesis
      By studies of cultured fibroblasts from homozygotes, Goldstein and Brown (1973) and Brown and Goldstein (1974) showed that the basic defect concerns the cell membrane receptor for LDL. Normally, LDL is bound at the cell membrane and taken into the cell ending up in lysosomes where the protein is degraded and the cholesterol is made available for repression of microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. In familial hypercholesterolemia, there is a binding defect due to a dysfunctional receptor. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Harders-Spengel et al. (1982) presented evidence that the receptor defect is present on liver membranes. 

      To determine the influences of intrauterine and genetic factors on atherogenic lipid profiles in later life, Ijzerman et al. (2001) investigated 53 dizygotic and 61 monozygotic adolescent twin pairs. They found an association between low birth weight and high levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B that persisted in the intrapair analysis in dizygotic twin pairs but was reversed within monozygotic twin pairs. Furthermore, they found that the association between low birth weight and low levels of HDL cholesterol tended to persist in the intrapair analysis in both dizygotic and monozygotic twins. These data suggested that genetic factors may account for the association of low birth weight with high levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, whereas intrauterine factors possibly play a role in the association of low birth weight with low levels of HDL cholesterol. 

      Garcia-Otin et al. (2007) determined serum noncholesterol sterols in normolipidemic control subjects and in well-phenotyped patients with dyslipidemias, including autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) with and without known genetic defects and familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL; 144250). Intestinal cholesterol absorption was highest in ADH without known defect, followed by ADH with known defect, then controls, and then FCHL. Garcia-Otin et al. (2007) concluded that intestinal cholesterol absorption might play a role in the lipid abnormalities of patients with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia without identified genetic defects. They suggested that serum noncholesterol sterols are a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of genetic hypercholesterolemias.

      Molecular Genetics
      Bull et al. (1993) identified 2 patients with Wilson disease who were homozygous for a 7-bp deletion within the coding region of the ATP7B gene (606882.0001). Tanzi et al. (1993) identified 4 mutations in the ATP7B gene in unrelated persons with Wilson disease: 2 missense mutations (606882.0002-606882.0003) and 2 frameshift mutations resulting in a truncated gene product (606882.0004-606882.0005). The mutations were found among 50 unrelated families derived predominantly from the United States, 18 unrelated families from Russia, and 5 presumably unrelated families from Sicily. Clearly, Bull et al. (1993) and Tanzi et al. (1993) had independently isolated the same gene which was convincingly the one mutant in Wilson disease. 

      Thomas et al. (1995) reviewed the mutations found in the ATP7B gene. Their findings suggest a wide span in the age of onset of Wilson disease, perhaps wider than previously considered typical. Mutations that completely disrupt the gene can produce liver disease in early childhood at a time when Wilson disease may not be considered in the differential diagnosis. 

      Petrukhin et al. (1993) identified YACs spanning the Wilson disease region and derived cosmid contigs therefrom. Thirteen microsatellite markers were generated from cosmids and used for study of genetic equilibrium (linkage disequilibrium; LD). Strong LD was detected between these markers and the WND locus in 28 families from rural Russia, 43 families from Sardinia, and 67 families of predominantly North American and European descent. From their haplotype and mutation analyses, Petrukhin et al. (1993) predicted that approximately half of all Wilson disease mutations will be rare in the American and Russian populations. 

      Given the difficulties of searching for mutations in a gene spanning more than 80 kb of genomic DNA, haplotype data are important as a guide to mutation detection. Thomas et al. (1995) did haplotyping of the Wilson disease gene region in 58 families. These haplotypes, combining 3 markers (D13S314, D13S316, and D13S301), were usually specific for each different mutation. The haplotype data suggested that as many as 20 mutations might still be unidentified; a total of 25 disease-causing mutations had been identified at that time

      Genotype/Phenotype Correlations
      Gromadzka et al. (2005) studied 142 Polish patients with Wilson disease and identified 26 mutations in the ATP7B gene: 11 truncating, 14 missense, and 1 splice site mutation. Patients with 1 or 2 truncating mutations on their alleles had lower serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels and were younger when the first symptoms of the disease appeared compared with individuals with 2 missense mutations, and the effect of truncating mutations on phenotype was dose-dependent. Gromadzka et al. (2005) found no association between type of ATP7B mutation and mode of initial disease presentation (neurologic, hepatic, or mixed).

      Clinical description
      The clinical spectrum is very wide, even within affected families. Likewise, age of onset is highly variable. Some patients remain asymptomatic for decades while few present symptoms before age 3 to 5. The disease can be observed in children after 3 years and most cases develop by 40 years of age. Late-onset cases after the fifth decade of life have also been described. Clinical presentation depends on gender and age. In children, at an average age of 10 years, hepatic manifestations typically prevail, most often commencing with liver damage. In general, hepatic manifestations (hepatomegaly, subacute or chronic hepatitis, acute liver failure or cirrhosis with portal hypertension) commonly precedes neurologic symptoms. Neurological manifestations (dystonia, intention tremor, dysarthria, coordination difficulties, chorea, choreoathetosis, and gait disorders) can be found in conjunction with hepatic symptoms or might also be the first clinical symptoms. Isolated psychiatric disorders (depression, phobias, compulsive behavior, personality changes, aggressiveness, or emotional instability) are rare and more commonly observed in conjunction with hepatic or neurologic disease. A wide range of other manifestations may also be present in affected patients: acute hemolytic episodes, delayed puberty, amenorrhea, repetitive miscarriage, Kayser-Fleischer rings due to copper deposits in the Descemet membrane, bone pain, arthralgia and osteoporosis, arrythmia, myocardiopathy, hematuria, nephrotic syndrome and renal lithiasis. Hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported in rare cases.

      Etiology
      The disease is due to chronic copper toxicosis, caused by pathogenic ATP7B (13q14.3) variants which leads to impaired copper elimination and subsequent accumulation in body tissues, particularly in the liver initially and then the brain and other organs.

      Diagnostic methods
      The variable presentation (hepatic, neurologic, psychiatric) complicates diagnosis which is based primarily on the combination of clinical features, and abnormal laboratory tests (elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, low serum ceruloplasmin, elevated urinary copper excretion). Liver biopsy may be performed to demonstrate high copper levels. Evaluation of liver copper from biopsies can be helpful. Diagnostic scoring system is commonly applied to establish diagnosis, still the diagnostic approach should start with ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion evaluation. Molecular genetic testing most often confirms the diagnosis in 98% of cases. Family screening identifies 20% of cases.

      Clinical description
      The clinical manifestations of this disease are highly variable. GD type 1 (90% of cases) is the chronic and non-neurological form associated with organomegaly (spleen, liver), bone anomalies (pain, osteonecrosis, pathological fractures) and cytopenia. Type 2, the acute neurological form, is characterized by early onset, rapidly progressing brainstem dysfunction, associated with organomegaly and leading to death before the age of 2. Type 3, the subacute neurological form, affects children or adolescents and is characterized by progressive encephalopathy (oculomotor apraxia, epilepsy and ataxia) with the systemic manifestations seen in type 1. The fetal form manifests with a decrease or absence of fetal movements or anasarca. Gaucher-like disease presents with progressive calcification of the aorta and the aortic and/ or mitral valves as its main feature.

      Etiology
      GD is due to mutations in the GBA gene (1q21) that codes for a lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase, or in very rare cases the PSAP gene that codes for its activator protein (saposin C). The deficiency in glucocerebrosidase leads to the accumulation of glucosylceramide (or beta-glucocerebrosidase) deposits in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system of the liver, the spleen and the bone marrow (Gaucher cells).

      Diagnostic methods
      Formal diagnosis of the disease is determined by the measurement of glucocerebrosidase levels in circulating leukocytes. Genotyping confirms the diagnosis.

      Pathogenesis
      Pandey et al. (2017) showed that activation of complement C5a (120900) and C5a receptor-1 (C5AR1; 113995) controls glucosylceramide (GC) accumulation and the inflammatory response in experimental and clinical Gaucher disease. Marked local and systemic complement activation occurred in glucocerebrosidase (GCase)-deficient mice or after pharmacologic inhibition of GCase and was associated with GC storage, tissue inflammation, and proinflammatory cytokine production. Whereas all GCase-inhibited mice died within 4 to 5 weeks, mice deficient in both GCase and C5aR1, and wildtype mice in which GCase and C5aR were pharmacologically inhibited, were protected from these adverse effects and consequently survived. In mice and humans, GCase deficiency was associated with strong formation of complement-activating GC-specific IgG autoantibodies, leading to complement activation and C5a generation. Subsequent C5aR1 activation controlled UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase production, thereby tipping the balance between GC formation and degradation. Thus, extensive GC storage induces complement-activating IgG autoantibodies that drive a pathway of C5a generation and C5aR1 activation that fuels a cycle of cellular GC accumulation and innate and adaptive immune cell recruitment and activation in Gaucher disease. Pandey et al. (2017) suggested that targeting C5AR1 may serve as a treatment option for patients with Gaucher disease and possibly other lysosomal storage diseases.

      Clinical description
      The clinical features of MODY vary depending on the genetic etiology. The most frequent subtypes are HNF1A-MODY (30-50%), GCK-MODY (30-50%), HNF4A-MODY (10%), and HNF1B-MODY (1-5%). The latter is also known as renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (see this term). At least 9 other genetic subtypes have been described but are very rare. Patients with HNF1A and HNF4A mutations have slowly progressing beta-cell dysfunction and respond well to treatment with low-dose sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first line therapy. Vascular complications of diabetes are observed with a similar frequency to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Low C-Reactive Protein is seen in HNF1A-MODY and neonatal hypoglycaemia and macrosomia are reported in babies with HNF4A-MODY. GCK-MODY is characterized by asymptomatic non-progressing mild fasting hyperglycemia with low post-prandial glucose excursions from birth, is not associated with vascular complications and does not require treatment.

      Etiology
      Mutations in at least 13 genes have been reported to be associated with a MODY phenotype: common causes (>5% of cases): HNF1A (12q24.31), GCK (7p15.3-p15.1), HNF4A (20q13.12); rare causes (about 1% of cases): KCNJ11 (11p15.1), ABCC8 (11p15.1), INS (11p15.5), HNF1B (17q12); and very rare (described in only a few families, genetic evidence not compelling for some): CEL (9q34.3), PDX1 (13q12.1), NEUROD1 (2q32), PAX4 (7q32.1), KLF11 (2p25) and BLK (8p23-p22).
