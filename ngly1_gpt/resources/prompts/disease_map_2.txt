The following text contains information from a published, biomedical research article about {disease}:

--- BEGIN TEXT ---
{text}
--- END TEXT ---

This was summarized as a description of a graph (aka network) containing biological entities and processes that are hypothesized to be involved in the etiology of {disease} as follows:

--- BEGIN DESCRIPTION ---
{description}
--- END DESCRIPTION ---

Convert this description into a structed graph representation in node-link JSON format, using all of the above context where appropriate. Requirements:

- Include ALL entities (nodes) and relations (edges) described
- Include "{disease}" as a node
- Use integer ids for the nodes and a `label` property containing their names
- Add a node `type` property that best captures what kind of node it is
- Include an edge `type` property describing the nature of the relation between nodes 

Here is an example showing a partial response with placeholder values:

--- BEGIN EXAMPLE JSON ---
{{
  "nodes": [
    {{"id": $node_integer_id, "label": $node_label, "type": $node_type}},
    ...
  ],
  "links": [
    {{"source": $node_integer_id_1, "target": $node_integer_id_2, "type": $edge_type}},
    ...
  ]
}}
--- END EXAMPLE JSON ---

Report only the JSON data.  Do not include other text or explanations of any kind.
