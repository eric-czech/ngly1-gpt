Here is the text to extract relations from: 
--- BEGIN TEXT ---
{text}
--- END TEXT ---

Report each relation record on a separate line in CSV format using a pipe (i.e. "|") delimiter with the column headers: `subject`, `subject_entity`, `predicate`, `object`, `object_entity`.

Requirements for extracted relations:

- All `subject` and `object` values must be INDIVIDUAL, specific, named concepts that represent an instance of one of the biomedical entities listed above.
- The `subject_entity` and `object_entity` values must be exactly one of the biomedical entities listed above (e.g. "pathway" or "disease"), and they must describe the entity associated with the specific `subject` and `object`, repsectively.
- All `predicate` values must be EXACTLY equivalent to one of the provided predicates (e.g. "causes" or "participates in"); do not use predicates outside of this list.
- Assume that "{disease}" is associated with any entities discussed where context does not dictate otherwise, as is this is the primary subject of the article.
- Extract as many relations as possible; do not ignore any of them that match the criteria provided.
- Include the CSV headers in the response.
- If there are no relations to extract in the text, return only the CSV headers.

Here is an example response with illustrative data that demonstrates the desired result format:
--- BEGIN EXAMPLE ---
subject|subject_entity|predicate|object|object_entity
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome|disease|has phenotype|osteolysis|phenotype
--- END EXAMPLE ---

Report only the relation records without explanation or other text of any kind.
