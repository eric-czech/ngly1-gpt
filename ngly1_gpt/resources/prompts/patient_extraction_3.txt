The following table in pipe-delimited CSV format contains details about individual rare disease patients:

--- BEGIN PATIENT DETAILS ---
{details}
--- END PATIENT DETAILS ---

Extract these details into individual records matching the following JSON Schema:

--- BEGIN JSON SCHEMA ---
{schema}
--- END JSON SCHEMA ---

Requirements:

- Create only one record per patient based on the `patient_accession` field
  - Extract ALL details into the provided schema unless any one piece of information has no suitable destination field in the schema
  - If the provided `patient_accession` is "ALL", merge the associated details with EVERY other patient record; do not create a resulting RECORD where `patient_accession` is "ALL" unless no details are provided with more specific patient identifiers
- STANDARDIZE the values of fields as much as possible such that they are consistent and directly comparable between patients
- Report the results in JSON lines format, i.e. as individual JSON objects on separate lines
- Do not wrap the results as a single JSON list or object
- Do NOT include explanation of any kind; report only the JSON content
