The following table in pipe-delimited CSV format contains details about individual rare disease patients:

--- BEGIN PATIENT DETAILS ---
{details}
--- END PATIENT DETAILS ---

Extract these details into individual records matching the following JSON Schema:

--- BEGIN JSON SCHEMA ---
{schema}
--- END JSON SCHEMA ---

Requirements:

- Create exactly one output record for every input record
- Extract ALL details for each patient into the provided schema 
- If any one piece of information for a patient does not apply to a field in the schema well, summarize that information concisely and add it as an element in the `extra_info` field
  - Each element in `extra_info` must be no more than 10 words
  - There must be no more than 30 elements in `extra_info` for a given record
  - Avoid using `extra_info` as much as possible; prioritize the more structured fields instead
- STANDARDIZE the values of fields as much as possible such that they are consistent and directly comparable between patients
- Report the results in JSON lines format, i.e. as individual JSON objects on separate lines
- Do not format the JSON objects for display purposes; ensure that they containing no breaking whitespace and that each result is reported on only ONE line
- Do NOT include any text in the response that cannot be parsed as valid JSON
- Do NOT include explanation or other text of any kind

Example response:  
{{"doc_id": "doc 1", "patient_accession": "1", ...}}
{{"doc_id": "doc 1", "patient_accession": "2", ...}}
