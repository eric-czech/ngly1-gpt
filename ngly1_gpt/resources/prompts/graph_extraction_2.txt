The following text contains information from a published, biomedical research article about {disease}:

--- BEGIN TEXT ---
{text}
--- END TEXT ---

This was summarized as a description of a graph (aka network) containing biological entities and processes that are hypothesized to be involved in the etiology of {disease} as follows:

--- BEGIN DESCRIPTION ---
{description}
--- END DESCRIPTION ---

Convert this description into a structed graph representation in node-link JSON format, using all of the above context where appropriate. Requirements:

- Include ALL entities (nodes) and relations (edges) described
- Include "{disease}" as a node
- Use integer ids for the nodes and a `label` property containing their names
- Add a node `type` property that best captures what kind of node it is
- Include an edge `type` property describing the nature of the relation between nodes 
- Add a node `therapeutic` property equal to "Unknown", "Management" or "Interventional" indicating whether or not a drug targeting the node would treat symptoms of the disease or treat the cause of the disease itself

Here is an example showing a partial response with required keys, but values that are not necessarily representative for this case:

--- BEGIN EXAMPLE JSON ---
{{
  "nodes": [
    {{"id": 1, "label": "Neurons", "type": "cell type", "therapeutic": "Management"}},
    ...
  ],
  "links": [
    {{"source": 1, "target": 2, "type": "causes"}},
    ...
  ]
}}
--- END EXAMPLE JSON ---

Report only the JSON data.  Do not include other text or explanations of any kind.
