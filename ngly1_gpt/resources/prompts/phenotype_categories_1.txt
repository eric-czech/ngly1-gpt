Define categories that best describe this list of human phenotypes associated with a disease:

--- BEGIN PHENOTYPE LIST ---
{phenotypes}
--- END PHENOTYPE LIST ---

Requirements:

- Define exactly {n_categories} categories that split these terms into roughly equally-sized groups
- Use an "Other" category for terms that do not fit well into a more specific group
- Report results in pipe (i.e. "|") delimited CSV format 
- Ensure that every single phenotype is included in the result and mapped to exactly one category
- Include two columns in the result: 
    - `phenotype_id`: Integer ID associated with each term in the provided list 
    - `category`: Name of category
- Include the headers in the result
- Ensure that the final result does not contain more than {n_categories} distinct category names
- Report only the CSV content and do not include explanation of any other kind
