The following taxonomy describes human phenotypes associated with {disease}:

--- BEGIN TAXONOMY JSON ---
{taxonomy}
--- END TAXONOMY JSON ---

Map the following list of human phenotypes associated with {disease} to the lowest level, terminal terms in this taxonomy:

--- BEGIN PHENOTYPE LIST ---
{phenotypes}
--- END PHENOTYPE LIST ---

Report results in CSV format with a pipe (i.e. "|") separator using the columns:

- `phenotype_id`: The integer id associated with an element in PHENOTYPE LIST
- `taxonomy_term_id`: The `id` of a single terminal object in TAXONOMY JSON

Ensure ALL phenotypes are included exactly once in the result, include the headers in the CSV content and report only the CSV records with no explanation of any kind.
