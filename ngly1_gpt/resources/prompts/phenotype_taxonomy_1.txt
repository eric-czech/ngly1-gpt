Define a taxonomy to describe the following list of human phenotypes associated with {disease}:

--- BEGIN PHENOTYPE LIST ---
{phenotypes}
--- END PHENOTYPE LIST ---

Requirements:

- Create this taxonomy as a single, nested JSON object
- There should be roughly 20 terms in the taxonomy overall and 3-5 levels when traversing any path downard through it from the top
- The top level term for the taxonomy must be "{disease} Phenotypes"
- Each object in the taxonomy must have only the fields `id`, `name`, `description` and `descendants` where:
  - `id` is an auto-incrementing integer unique to each term in the taxonomy
  - `name` is a representative name for the term
  - `description` is a more detailed explanation of what the term corresponds to
  - `descendants` is a list of all lower-level taxonomy objects
- Do not include the original phenotypes in the taxonomy; include only more general categorizations of these terms
- Report only the JSON for the taxonomy with no other explanation of any kind
