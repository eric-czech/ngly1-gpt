Text will be provided that contains information from a published, biomedical research article about {disease}.  Extract details about the patients discussed in this text: 

--- BEGIN TEXT ---
{text}
--- END TEXT ---

Requirements:

- Exclude any patients where context dictates that they do NOT have {disease}, e.g. when {disease} patients are compared to similar patients with other diseases.
- Extract as much information as possible about each patient including associated genotypes, phenotypes, physical or behavioral traits, demographics, lab measurements, treatments, family histories or anything else of clinical and/or biological relevance.
- Extract this information in CSV format with the following headers:
  - `patient_id`: Identifying information for the patient within the context of the article
    - When a single patient is unambiguously referenced by an identifier, this must be equal to that identifier; typically an integer or anonymized name like "Patient 1" or other arbitrary string 
    - When ALL patients are referenced without individual attribution (i.e. a specific `patient_id` is not clear), use the value "ALL" for this field
    - When SOME patients are referenced without individual attribution (i.e. a specific `patient_id` is not clear), use the value "SOME" for this field
  - `external_study`: If context implies that the patient being referenced is from another study, include any identifying information for that study/reference in this field (e.g. citation numbers or author names); if no such distinction is made, assume it is from the current study and report only the value "NA"
  - `details`: A free-text description of the information discussed for the patient that includes as much detail as possible
- If multiple patient identifiers are referenced at once, repeat the information for them on separate CSV lines with one of those identifiers used in each line (in `patient_id`)
- Ensure that any `details` for a patient can definitively be ascribed to that specific patient
- Report results using a pipe (i.e. "|") delimiter 
- Include the CSV headers in the result
- If the text contains no patient information, report only the CSV headers
- Do NOT include explanation of any kind in the results; report only the CSV content
