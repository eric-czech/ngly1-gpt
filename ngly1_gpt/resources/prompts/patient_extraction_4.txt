The following table in pipe-delimited CSV format contains details about individual rare disease patients:

--- BEGIN PATIENT DETAILS ---
{details}
--- END PATIENT DETAILS ---

Identify any statements that provide a count of patients with a particular phenotype.

Report these statements as pipe (i.e. "|") delimited CSV records with the columns:

- `doc_id`: The provided `doc_id` for the statement
- `phenotype`: The phenotype mentioned in the statement
  - If multiple phenotypes are mentioned in one statement, as will often be the case, split them into multiple rows in the resulting CSV
  - This value must be a SINGLE phenotype
- `n_patients`: The number (as an integer) of patients mentioned that definitely, with no ambiguity, have the phenotype also mentioned

Requirements:
- Ingore statements that do not mention a phenotype and an associated count for that phenotype
- Extract as many phenotype patient counts as possible
- Return the headers in the response
- If no eligible statements are found, report only the headers

Example response:
doc_id|phenotype|n_patients
PMC1|low cholesterol|3
