      "Purpose: The endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway is responsible for the translocation of misfolded proteins across the ER membrane into the cytosol for subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In order to understand the spectrum of clinical and molecular findings in a complex neurological syndrome, we studied a series of eight patients with inherited deficiency of N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1), a novel disorder of cytosolic ERAD dysfunction.\n",
      "Methods: Whole-genome, whole-exome or standard Sanger sequencing techniques were employed. Retrospective chart reviews were performed in order to obtain clinical data.\n",
      "Results: All patients had global developmental delay, a movement disorder, and hypotonia.

    "# DISCUSSION\n",
    "# Summary of Novel Findings\n",
    "# Our prospective investigations into NGLY1-CDDG revealed several new discoveries associated with this disorder. These included low CSF total protein and albumin, optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone dystrophy, poor weight gain starting in mid- childhood, lower than predicted resting energy expenditure, central and obstructive sleep apnea, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, progressive brain atrophy, abnormalities in brain MRS-measured metabolites, various abnormalities on skeletal survey, high antibody titers after rubella and rubeola vaccination, and low levels of several pro- and anti- coagulation factors. Echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and CSF lactate levels were normal.\n",
    "# We also confirmed and further detailed the global developmental delay, movement disorder, frequent seizure disorder, hypotonia, hypolacrima or alacrima, corneal disease, ptosis, lagophthalmous, strabismus, peripheral neuropathy and occasional diminished reflexes, hypohidrosis, auditory brainstem response abnormalities, abnormal brain imaging, scoliosis, acquired microcephaly, small hands and feet, dysmorphic features, constipation, elevated liver enzymes present only early in childhood, osteopenia, and hypocholesterolemia associated with NGLY1-CDDG. Compared with previously reported biopsy findings, our transient elastography results showed minimal if any fibrosis. In addition, we could not confirm abnormal storage material in the three liver biopsy specimens we analyzed, nor did we observe ocular apraxia in our individuals, despite performing detailed ophthalmologic evaluations that involved some subjects previously reported to have ocular apraxia11.\n",
    "# Based on our findings, we recommend considering NGLY1-CDDG in the differential diagnosis of any patient with the tetrad of developmental delay/intellectual disability, hyperkinetic movement disorder, hypolacrima, and a history of elevated transaminases during early childhood.\n",

    "Our detailed assessment of the phenotypic features has also led to several hypotheses regarding underlying pathophysiology. The strong correlation between brain atrophy on MRI and functional assessments suggests that loss of neurons contributes to the functional impairment. The atrophy also correlated with CSF metabolites (BH4, 5-HIAA, HVA), which are known to be lower when there is damage to neurotransmitter producing neurons22â€“24. This suggests that these biochemical abnormalities may be secondary to brain atrophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results from MRS showed that as functional impairment worsened and age increased, NAA decreased, while choline, myo-inositol and creatine increased. Additionally, creatine and myoinositol were inversely correlated, and NAA directly correlated, with neurotransmitter levels (5-HIAA, 5-HVA, 3-OMD, and neopterin, Supplementary Figure S3). NAA may be found exclusively in neurons and declines as neurons become unhealthy or die25,26. Elevations in choline could be consistent with a relative abundance of glial cells secondary to neuronal loss26. Myo-inositol is a glia-specific marker that is elevated by gliosis or inflammation27,28; in our cohort we do not have any evidence of inflammation. Creatine levels are relatively higher in glial cells compared to neurons29. Taken together, the MRS findings suggest that there is a relative abundance of glial cells compared to neurons in the brain of NGLY1-CDDG individuals, possibly due to loss of neurons, and that the degree of this imbalance contributes significantly to the severity of the phenotype.\n",

    "The impaired sweat response, largely affecting distal responses, is consistent with a small fiber neuropathy rather than a central etiology or generalized cholinergic dysfunction. Albumin CSF/serum quotient, or QAlb, is a marker of blood-CSF barrier dysfunction, and its value is inversely correlated to the CSF turnover rate30. There was no significant change in the QAlb ratio (data not shown), arguing against increased turnover as a possible etiology. Regardless of the mechanism, we propose that decreased CSF protein and albumin concentrations represent a novel diagnostic marker for this disorder.\n",

    "Individuals with NGLY1-CDDG and those with N-linked glycosylation disorders share the phenotypic features of low cholesterol, hepatopathy, peripheral neuropathy, retinal and optic nerve abnormalities, seizures, developmental delay with socialization as a relative strength, and delayed bone age18. NGLY1-CDDG also overlaps with O-linked glycosylation disorders with respect to hypolacrima19. There may be a pathogenic relationship; N-glycanase 1 catalyzes the cleavage of the amide bond between the proximal N-acetylglucosamine residue of glycans and the asparagine residue of the protein9, so NGLY1-CDDG could impair glycan recycling and lead to hypoglycosylation. Indeed, the individuals with NGLY1-CDDG exhibited subtle abnormalities in transferrin and ApoC-III glycosylation20.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another hypothesis for the etiology of the NGLY1-CDDG phenotype is based on the fact that misfolded glycoproteins are processed through the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway (ERAD) and then retrotranslocated into the cytoplasm. There, N-glycanase is the first step in further degradation of these molecules, making ERAD dysfunction a possible pathophysiologic contributor especially given evidence of ER-stress in mouse embryonic fibroblasts31. However, preliminary experiments found no impairment or enhancement of standard ERAD marker expression under normal conditions in NGLY1-CDDG patient fibroblasts (H.H. Freeze, personal communication, April 2016).\n",
