There was a deficit of glutamine + glutamate + gamma-aminobutyric acid (Glx) in the PGM (p=0.03), LCSO (p=0.01), and pons (p=0.0002). Choline was higher than expected for age only in the LCSO (p=0.0097), and myo-inositol was higher than expected for age in the pons (p=0.002). Multiple correlations between these MRS-measured metabolites and age, functional assessments, brain volume, and neurotransmitters in the CSF were found. The general trend showed that the differences noted above became more pronounced with increasing age, worsening function, and lower brain volume. MRS metabolite measurements did not correlate with total CSF protein, CSF albumin, or CSF/serum albumin ratio. There was a weak correlation (p=0.09) between atrophy and total CSF protein, but not CSF albumin or CSF/serum albumin ratio.  \n",

The atrophy also correlated with CSF metabolites (BH4, 5-HIAA, HVA), which are known to be lower when there is damage to neurotransmitter producing neurons. This suggests that these biochemical abnormalities may be secondary to brain atrophy.  "

They experience difficulty hearing in the presence of background noise and benefit from quiet listening environments. If hypohidrosis is detected, preventative measures (hydration, ventilation, etc.) against situations that cause dangerous core body hyperthermia can be taken. It is important to aggressively manage hypo-lacrima with artificial tears and bland ointment to prevent secondary complications that can impact vision. They have disordered mastication for solids but a functional ability to swallow, suggesting the need for oral motor and swallowing therapies to facilitate better control and chewing maturation.   \n",

       "33   16-year-old girl, older sister of Subject 7, born at term via Cesarean section for decreased fetal movement and bradycardia. Prenatal history was significant for IUGR. Had cyanosis at birth and required resuscitation. Anal stenosis requiring dilatation was noted in the first week of life. Noted to have hypotonia, a movement disorder consisting of head bobbing and extremity athetosis, and developmental delay in early infancy. At 3 years, she could stand unsupported, ambulate with a walker, and started to babble. Seizures developed at age 11 years and she lost all mobility. Other medical history includes acquired microcephaly, an inability to close her eyes completely during sleep, chronic conjunctivitis, corneal clouding, hypolacrima, strabismus, hearing impairment, gastro-esophageal reflux, chronic constipation, severe scoliosis and talipes equinovarus.   \n",

      "\n",
      "--- BEGIN DETAILS LIST ---\n",
      "- Femoral bone density was low in all nine individuals who underwent DEXA scanning (mean, SEM z-scores for 8 patients < 21 years adjacent to the growth plate = −3, 0.4; metaphysis-diaphysis = −2.2, 0.6, and diaphysis = −1.8, 0.5).\n",
      "- Patient 8 has a homozygous state of the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation. This mutation is associated with a severe phenotype, with outcomes ranging from early demise to living into teenage years.\n",
      "- Two individuals had combined obstructive and central sleep apnea\n",
      "- 12 individuals ages 2 to 21 years with confirmed, biallelic, pathogenic NGLY1 mutations. Clinical features include optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone dystrophy, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, and lower than predicted resting energy expenditure. Laboratory findings include low CSF total protein and albumin, and unusually high antibody titers towards rubella and/or rubeola following vaccination. Confirmed and further quantified previously reported findings noting that decreased tear production, transient transaminitis, small feet, a complex hyperkinetic movement disorder, and varying degrees of global developmental delay with relatively preserved socialization are the most consistent features.\n",
      "- Six of nine individuals had qualitatively-evident cerebral atrophy that ranged from slight to moderate.\n",
      "- Patient 1 has a compound heterozygous state of the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation.\n",
      "- The most common deleterious allele was the nonsense mutation c.1201A>T (p.R401X).\n",
      "- 5 out of 6 patients had hepatocyte cytoplasmic storage material or vacuolization.\n",
      "- Ten of twelve subjects were born at term; two were born at 36 and 34 weeks, respectively. In the majority of individuals, birth weight, length, and occipital-frontal circumference (OFC) were appropriate for gestational age.\n",
      "- These transaminase levels normalized around age 4.\n",
      "- Patient 6 has a homozygous state of the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation. This mutation is associated with a severe phenotype, with outcomes ranging from early demise to living into teenage years.\n",
      "- All twelve subjects had at least some developmental delay or intellectual disability, with a broad range of severity. IQ was below average (n=2) or in the range of intellectual disability (n=9) for the entire group; seven individuals had profound intellectual disability. The two individuals with IQ below average were verbally fluent; the remainder were nonverbal (n=7) or used only single words (n=1) or phrase speech (n=1).\n",
      "- Patients considered for NGLY1-CDDG differential diagnosis due to the tetrad of developmental delay/intellectual disability, hyperkinetic movement disorder, hypolacrima, and a history of elevated transaminases during early childhood.\n",
      "- Had slight cerebellar atrophy.\n",
      "- 3 year old male with NGLY1 deficiency. Allele 1 mutation: c.953T>C (p.L318P). Allele 2 mutation: c.1169G>C (p.R390P). Nijmegen score: 14. Vineland score: 62. IQ or DQ not determined.\n",
      "- Significant brain disease was noted on autopsy, found to have pathological changes consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)\n",
      "- 4 year old male with NGLY1 deficiency. Allele 1 mutation: c.1201A>T (p.R401*). Allele 2 mutation: c.1201A>T (p.R401*). Nijmegen score: 33. IQ or DQ: 25. Vineland score: 52.\n",
      "- Seven of twelve subjects had clinical seizures, and one had subclinical seizures recognized on previous EEG. There were no age or genotype differences between individuals having seizures and those without. In each sibling pair, one had seizures and the other did not.\n",
      "- Hematologic profiles showed unremarkable complete blood counts\n",
      "- All twelve individuals exhibited hyperkinetic movement disorders that included choreiform, athetoid, dystonic, myoclonic, action tremor, and dysmetric movements and were more severe in the younger individuals.\n",
      "- In the two oldest subjects, CSF 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were decreased, suggesting neuronal loss.\n",
      "- Nine subjects underwent lumbar puncture. CSF total protein and albumin concentrations, as well as the CSF/serum albumin ratios, were low in nearly all individuals. There was no correlation between age and CSF protein or albumin levels. CSF 5-HIAA, HVA, and BH4 levels strongly and directly correlated with brain atrophy. CSF lactate and amino acid levels were essentially normal. CSF leucocyte counts (0–4; normal 0–5), glucose concentrations (54–72 mg/dL; normal 40–70), 3-O-methyldopa concentrations (12–28 nM; normal <150) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations (45– 85 nmol/L; normal 40–150) were unremarkable.\n",
      "- Bone age was delayed in eight of the 11 subjects tested without any consistent abnormalities of the endocrine system: the somatotropic axis and thyroid function were normal in all studied individuals.\n",
      "- Two of eleven individuals showed white matter lesions in their brain MRI findings. One had multiple lesions in the periventricular white matter, some of which were confluent. The other had a single lesion in the periventricular white matter. Both showed cerebral atrophy and slightly prominent sulci. One of them had prominent ventricles.\n",
      "- Patient 7 has a homozygous state of the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation. This mutation is associated with a severe phenotype, with outcomes ranging from early demise to living into teenage years.\n",
      "- All subjects had joint hypermobility except the older ones, who had contractures in both small and large joints.\n",
      "- 5-year-old male, presented in the neonatal period with involuntary movements, including athetosis involving the trunk and extremities and constant lip smacking and pursing while awake. Pregnancy and birth history were unremarkable. He had mild neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy, but otherwise appeared well. Global developmental delay, hypotonia, intractable multifocal epilepsy, consisting of myoclonic seizures, drop attacks, and staring or tonic episodes, and liver disease were present in infancy. He has cortical vision loss and congenital alacrima and corneal ulcerations with scarring were noted at age 4 years. Now, at age 5 years, the movement disorder has not abated and he has central hypotonia and global developmental delay.\n",
      "- Low Factor II activity was observed in 1 subject\n",
      "- Our prospective investigations into NGLY1-CDDG revealed several new discoveries associated with this disorder. These included low CSF total protein and albumin, optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone dystrophy, poor weight gain starting in mid- childhood, lower than predicted resting energy expenditure, central and obstructive sleep apnea, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, progressive brain atrophy, abnormalities in brain MRS-measured metabolites, various abnormalities on skeletal survey, high antibody titers after rubella and rubeola vaccination, and low levels of several pro- and anti- coagulation factors. Echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and CSF lactate levels were normal.\n",
      "- 16-year-old girl, older sister of Subject 7, born at term via Cesarean section for decreased fetal movement and bradycardia. Prenatal history was significant for IUGR. Had cyanosis at birth and required resuscitation. Anal stenosis requiring dilatation was noted in the first week of life. Noted to have hypotonia, a movement disorder consisting of head bobbing and extremity athetosis, and developmental delay in early infancy. At 3 years, she could stand unsupported, ambulate with a walker, and started to babble. Seizures developed at age 11 years and she lost all mobility. Other medical history includes acquired microcephaly, an inability to close her eyes completely during sleep, chronic conjunctivitis, corneal clouding, hypolacrima, strabismus, hearing impairment, gastro-esophageal reflux, chronic constipation, severe scoliosis and talipes equinovarus.\n",
      "- 3-year-old boy with compound heterozygous inactivating mutations in NGLY1. Clinical phenotype suggestive of a congenital disorder of glycosylation, although repeated transferrin isoelectric focusing and N-glycan analyses were normal. Liver biopsy showed accumulation of an amorphous unidentified substance throughout the cytoplasm, a finding likely consistent with NGLY1 dysfunction, which would be expected to result in abnormal accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins because of impaired cytosolic degradation.\n",
      "- Neopterin levels were normal but decreased with age, and CSF tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels were below the lower limit of normal in all but one subject tested; however, there was no correlation with age.\n",
      "- One individual had central sleep apnea\n",
      "- WES (Baylor College of Medicine Whole Genome Laboratory) revealed a homozygous mutation in exon 9 of the NGLY1 gene denoted as c.1370dupG or p.R458fs. Both parents were confirmed to be heterozygous carriers by Sanger sequencing. The mutation causes a frame shift in codon 458, causing insertion of 13 incorrect residues before a stop codon is introduced towards the end of exon 9. The mutation was not seen in any of 3321 other subjects sequenced at Duke, nor was it seen in 6503 subjects on the Exome Variant Server (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA.\n",
      "- NGLY1 deficiency (OMIM: 610661 and 615273), or NGLY1-CDDG, was first reported in 2012 by Need et al., who, through exome sequencing, identified biallelic mutations in the NGLY1 gene as the cause of disease in one child.\n",
      "- A moderate reduction in mitochondrial DNA content was identified in a liver sample\n",
      "- 3 year old, female, Caucasian, no consanguinity, mutations: c.1201A>Y(p. R401X)/c.1201A>T(p.R401X), no IUGR, no brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, ocular apraxia, alacrima/hypolacrima, chalazions, strabismus, lactic acidosis, neonatal jaundice, elevated liver transaminases, constipation, dysmorphic features\n",
      "- Parents of the index case had reduced NGLY1 protein expression in leukocytes compared to controls.\n",
      "- 11 individuals under age 18 years were evaluated using the Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Severity scale. Total Nijmegen scores ranged from 9 (mild) to 52 (severe), with a mean of 28 ± 4 (SEM); the median was 32.\n",
      "- 20 year old, female, Caucasian, consanguinity, mutations: c.1370dupG(p.R458fs)/c.1370dupG(p.R458fs), IUGR, no brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, ocular apraxia, alacrima/hypolacrima, corneal ulcerations/scarring, elevated liver transaminases, liver storage or vacuolization, constipation, scoliosis, peripheral neuropathy\n",
      "- Three of twelve had Fibroscan scores above 7 kPa, the upper limit of normal, indicating possible liver fibrosis.\n",
      "- Seven of 11 individuals tested exhibited out of range elevations in antibody titers towards rubella and/or rubeola following MMR vaccination. Biochemical markers known to be abnormal in mitochondropathies and hypoglycosylation disorders showed inconsistent results.\n",
      "- In the two subjects with the lowest cholesterol levels, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and very low density lipoprotein particle number and sizes were normal.\n",
      "- WES was performed on a clinical basis at Emory Genetics Laboratory, Atlanta, Georgia.\n",
      "- Clinical studies were designed to detail the phenotypic features of NGLY1-CDDG. Blood, urine, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), lymphoblasts, and primary dermal fibroblasts were collected, analyzed, and stored. Studies included brain magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI and MRS), routine and overnight electroencephalograms (EEGs) with a limited montage performed during a sleep study, electromyogram (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS), indirect calorimetry, awake and sedated eye examination with Schirmer II testing, optical coherence tomography scans and electroretinography, behavioral determination of pure tone thresholds, tympanometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem evoked potentials (ABR), quantitative sweat analysis autonomic testing (QSWEAT), gastric aspiration, swallow study, skeletal survey, bone age, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), abdominal ultrasound, vibration controlled transient elastography (Fibroscan), echocardiogram, and electrocardiogram. Consultations included clinical neurology, audiology, nutrition, ophthalmology, hepatology, growth, puberty and hormonal studies, allergy and immunology, genetic counseling, physiatry, and speech, occupational, and physical therapy. Eleven individuals underwent developmental psychological evaluations, consisting of at least the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 2nd edition. Cognitive function was assessed with testing specific for age and developmental level that provided either an intelligence quotient (IQ) or developmental quotient (DQ) score. In addition, the Nijmegen pediatric CDG rating scale, a measure of clinical disease progression developed for CDG, was applied to all affected individuals younger than 18 years.\n",
      "- Circulating proteins were normal or borderline low in all individuals.\n",
      "- The variant in NGLY1, single nucleotide variant T> A at position 3:25775422 (hg19), which was called to be homozygous, was present in the mother’s exome as a heterozygous call. This base pair substitution causes a nonsense mutation, R401X. The NGLY1 variant was independently validated by Sanger sequencing in the patient and both parents.\n",
      "- Patients have low Motor Skills scores and Daily Living Skills scores due to significant motor involvement required for daily tasks. They have a hyperkinetic movement disorder due to NGLY1-CDDG. This disorder may be caused by myoclonic seizures, neurotransmitter deficiency, and/or peripheral neuropathy manifesting as sensory ataxia.\n",
      "- 0.5 year old, male, Caucasian, no consanguinity, mutations: c.1201A>T(p. R401X)/c.1201A>T(p.R401X), IUGR, brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, seizures, alacrima/hypolacrima, elevated liver transaminases, elevated AFP, liver storage or vacuolization, constipation, dysmorphic features, scoliosis\n",
      "- Has a sibling also with NGLY1 deficiency (#8).\n",
      "- On the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition, composite scores ranged from 24 to 98 with a mean of 51 (SEM = 7). There was a consistent profile characterized by relatively strong Socialization scores, followed by Communication, and Daily Living Skills. Motor deficits were also reflected in impaired Daily Living Skills scores. Vineland scores were higher than cognitive scores for all subjects. No cross-sectional relationship between age and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite was found.\n",
      "- Sleep studies identified evidence of obstructive sleep apnea in two individuals\n",
      "- Increased atrophy correlated with worsening of all functional measurements, including IQ or DQ, Vineland assessments, and Nijmegen scores. Brain volume also directly correlated with CSF levels of 5-HIAA, tetrahydrobiopterin, and 5-HVA.\n",
      "- Nerve conduction studies were performed in 11 individuals. The predominant finding was an axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (n=8) with additional demyelinative features (n=6). Results of neurophysiological testing demonstrated a length- dependent, progressive loss of sensory and motor axons and sympathetic nerve function, apparently static abnormalities in myelination of peripheral nerves, and possible motor neuron degeneration.\n",
      "- 20-year-old female, born at 39 weeks of gestation via Cesarean section due to intrauterine growth retardation and an abnormal appearing placenta. Noted hypotonia, developmental delay and elevated liver transaminases at four months of age. At approximately 4 years of age, observed to have a slight intention tremor and frequent involuntary movements of her neck, hands and arm. At 5 years of age, she was noted to have ocular apraxia, distal tapering of hands and feet, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. She has cortical vision impairment, alacrima and dry eyes that require lubrication, but has not developed corneal scarring. Presently, she has marked intellectual disabilities and requires total care. She has very little expressive speech and communicates through an electronic speech-generating device. She continues to ambulate with a walker.\n",
      "- Three individuals scored in the mild range, two in the moderate range, and six in the severe range.\n",
      "- No hydronephrosis, polycystic kidneys, horseshoe kidneys, kidney calculi, nephrocalcinosis, or perinephric fluid were seen.\n",
      "- There was no significant difference in disease severity of males compared to females.\n",
      "- QSWEATs were performed in 11 individuals, abnormal results were found in 8 individuals who also had axonal sensorimotor neuropathies. The distal lower extremity QSWEAT was more frequently absent (7/11) compared to the forearm (1/11), indicating a length dependent neuropathy. There was a trend to greater severity of neuropathy in the older individuals, with an inverse correlation between tibial motor amplitude and age (p = 0.002, r2 = 0.799); the amplitude decreased by −0.3 mV per year (normal, >+2.5mV per year).\n",
      "- Awake and sedated ophthalmic examinations were performed on 11 study participants. Observed conditions include Lagophthalmous, ptosis, exotropia and/or esotropia, corneal neovascularization, pannus formation or scarring, optic nerve pallor or atrophy, retinal.\n",
      "- 5 year old, male, Caucasian, no consanguinity, mutations: c.C1891del (p.Q631S)/c.1201A>T(p.R401X), no IUGR, brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, seizures, alacrima/hypolacrima, corneal ulcerations/scarring, chalazions, elevated liver transaminases, elevated AFP, liver fibrosis, liver storage or vacuolization, constipation, small hands/feet, peripheral neuropathy\n",
      "- Electrocardiograms showed heart rates in the low 100s\n",
      "- Individuals with NGLY1-CDDG have facial features including upturned nasal tip, hypotonic facies, ptosis, brachycephaly, thinned facies, hollowed cheeks, and visible zygomatic arches. Interpupillary distance ranged from the 13–95 centiles with the mean at the 66th centile, and SEM of 8. Horizontal fissure length ranged from 3–70 centiles with mean at the 20th centile, and SEM of 1. Inner canthal distance ranged from 3–100 centiles with the mean at the 59th centile and SEM of 10. Outer canthal distance ranged from 6–81 centile with mean at the 43 centile and SEM of 7. Canthal index ranged from −2 to +2 SD from the normal mean.\n",
      "- Patient 5, a boy, died at the age of 5 years. He was born at term following a pregnancy that was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screening for trisomy 18 and Smith- Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) (AFP 1.97 MoM, uE3 0.24 MoM and hCG 0.48 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal male karyotype and measurement of 7-dehydrocholesterol in amniotic fluid excluded SLOS. He was delivered by Cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation due to concerns for IUGR and a non-reassuring stress test. He had mild flexion contractures of both knees, but had an uneventful neonatal period. He had global developmental delay and constant movements of his arms and legs since early infancy and developed head bobbing at 7 months. At 8 months, liver transaminase elevations (approximately 1.5 times the upper limit of normal) were noted, and the elevations persisted until age 3 1⁄2 years. His reflexes appeared normal in infancy, but were diminished by age 2 years and at 38 months could no longer be elicited. During the second year of life, he was noted to have dry eyes that were treated with lubricant drops at bedtime, and microcephaly was present by 16 months. At 2 1⁄2 years, he developed myoclonic seizures that became intractable despite numerous therapeutic trials. Between the ages of 10 months and five years, he showed slow developmental progress, but regressed during the last year. He died at age 5 years following a viral illness and a prolonged seizure.\n",
      "- 18 year old female with NGLY1 deficiency. Allele 1 mutation: c.1201A>T (p.R401*). Allele 2 mutation: c.1201A>T (p.R401*). Nijmegen score: 52. IQ or DQ: 2. Vineland score: 24.\n",
      "- 3-year-old male with NGLY1 deficiency. Inherited a maternal c.1891delC (p.Q631S NM_018297.3) variant and a paternal c.1201A>T (p.R401* NM_018297.3) variant. NGLY1 protein expression in leukocytes was undetectable compared to controls. Transferrin isoelectric focusing and N-glycan profiling were normal.\n",
      "- 6 out of 7 patients had elevated liver transaminases.\n",
      "- NGLY1 deficiency is characterized by unique features including elevation of AFP and liver enzymes in infancy with relative normalization in early childhood, accumulation of a substance with staining properties similar to glycogen in hepatocyte cytoplasm, absent tears resulting in blepharitis and corneal ulceration, a movement disorder and peripheral neuropathy. The transient nature of the AFP and liver transaminase elevation may make older or more mildly affected individuals difficult to detect.\n",
      "- On needle EMG, neurogenic findings were noted in 9 subjects with varying degrees of acute and chronic changes consistent with the NCS results.\n",
      "- The sibling with a private cryptic splice site mutation (c.930C>T) and a private nonsense mutation (c.622C>T) exhibited relatively mild impairment in all domains.\n",
      "- Patients commonly had abnormalities detected on brain imaging, but findings were typically mild and non-specific. The combination of hypo- or alacrima and a movement disorder consisting of tremulousness and varying degrees of choreoathetosis appear to be pathognomonic for NGLY1 deficiency. Unlike CDGs, NGLY1 deficiency does not appear to be associated with cerebellar atrophy, lipodystrophy, or significant heart manifestations. Lactic acidemia was variably present, but tended to be mild; chronic elevations were not noted in any patient.\n",
      "- Exome sequencing was performed at Duke University using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform and the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon 50 Mb Kit.\n",
      "- 10 year old male with NGLY1 deficiency. Allele 1 mutation: c.622C>T (p.Q208*). Allele 2 mutation: c.930C>T (p.G310G - splice site). Nijmegen score: 9. IQ or DQ: 81. Vineland score: 94.\n",
      "- Preliminary experiments found no impairment or enhancement of standard ERAD marker expression under normal conditions in NGLY1-CDDG patient fibroblasts.\n",
      "- Gastric pH was assessed after H2 blockers and osmotic pump inhibitors had been discontinued for 5 days. Gastric pH was appropriately acidic in all individuals tested except one, whose pH was 7.25.\n",
      "- On overnight EEG, only one individual (#6) had active seizures recorded.\n",
      "- Findings noted only once included flexion deformity of the fingers, hallux valgus, sclerotic lesion of the distal femur, thinning of the fibulas, prominent apophyseal bone formation in the ileac crests and ischia, ulnar bowing, expansion of the cortexes in the proximal and middle phalanges in digits 2–4, widened phalanges, and shortened and widened metatarsals.\n",
      "- One individual had undergone liver transplantation for presumed hepatocellular carcinoma.\n",
      "- Individuals with NGLY1-CDDG share phenotypic features of low cholesterol, hepatopathy, peripheral neuropathy, retinal and optic nerve abnormalities, seizures, developmental delay with socialization as a relative strength, and delayed bone age. They also exhibit hypolacrima, a feature shared with O-linked glycosylation disorders. N-glycanase 1, which catalyzes the cleavage of the amide bond between the proximal N-acetylglucosamine residue of glycans and the asparagine residue of the protein, may be pathogenically related to NGLY1-CDDG. This could impair glycan recycling and lead to hypoglycosylation. Subtle abnormalities in transferrin and ApoC-III glycosylation were observed in these individuals.\n",
      "- Patients have axonal loss and gliosis in the brains suggestive of HIE, indicating that NGLY1 plays a role in maintaining central nervous system integrity. They also seem to have peripheral neuropathy that is relatively common in NGLY1 deficiency. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying pathogenesis of both central and peripheral nervous system abnormalities.\n",
      "- A single individual had a repeat study at one year, showing progression of the neuropathy.\n",
      "- Complete skeletal surveys were performed on 11 individuals; abnormalities included coxa valga (n=11), scoliosis (n=6), growth arrest lines or metaphyseal banding without palmidronate treatment (n=4), dislocations or subluxations involving the hips and shoulder joints (n=3), and sclerosis of the phalanges or tarsal bones (n=2).\n",
      "- In 2014, a retrospective chart review highlighted the most common findings in eight known NGLY1-CDDG patients.\n",
      "- Audiologic assessments, including otoacoustic emissions and/or cochlear microphonics to evaluate for the functional integrity of the inner ear, and auditory brainstem response (ABRs), were conducted on 11 subjects. Behavioral hearing thresholds could be established reliably in only three subjects and all had normal hearing sensitivity. Tympanometry was unremarkable. Most remarkable was the dyssynchronous and/or absent transmission through the auditory brainstem and/or 8th nerve in most individuals. The severity of the transmission abnormality through the auditory brainstem increased with increasing age, and the eighth nerve was bilaterally involved the 4 oldest individuals.\n",

Pregnancy and birth history were unremarkable. He had mild neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy, but otherwise appeared well. Global developmental delay, hypotonia, intractable multifocal epilepsy, consisting of myoclonic seizures, drop attacks, and staring or tonic episodes, and liver disease were present in infancy. He has cortical vision loss and congenital alacrima and corneal ulcerations with scarring were noted at age 4 years. Now, at age 5 years, the movement disorder has not abated and he has central hypotonia and global developmental delay. 4) Whole exome sequencing (WES) performed as part of a research protocol detected putative knock out mutations forming a compound heterozygote genotype in the NGLY1 gene (Maternal frameshift: Q631S. at cDNA level: C1891del in transcript ENST00000280700. EXON 12. Paternal nonsense: 3_25750426_A, which causes a nonsense mutation, R401X, in transcript ENST00000280700.

Noted hypotonia, developmental delay and elevated liver transaminases at four months of age. At approximately 4 years of age, observed to have a slight intention tremor and frequent involuntary movements of her neck, hands and arm. At 5 years of age, she was noted to have ocular apraxia, distal tapering of hands and feet, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. She has cortical vision impairment, alacrima and dry eyes that require lubrication, but has not developed corneal scarring. Presently, she has marked intellectual disabilities and requires total care. She has very little expressive speech and communicates through an electronic speech-generating device. She continues to ambulate with a walker. 4) Did not carry the c.1201A&gt;T (p.R401X) mutation and their clinical phenotype was relatively mild in comparison 5) WES (Baylor College of Medicine Whole Genome Laboratory) revealed a homozygous mutation in exon 9 of the NGLY1 gene denoted as c.1370dupG or p.R458fs. Both parents were confirmed to be heterozygous carriers by Sanger sequencing. The mutation causes a frame shift in codon 458, causing insertion of 13 incorrect residues before a stop codon is introduced towards the end of exon 9. The mutation was not seen in any of 3321 other subjects sequenced at Duke, nor was it seen in 6503 subjects on the Exome Variant Server (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA. 6) Patient 2 does not carry the c.1201A&gt;T (p.R401X) mutation and appears to have a relatively mild phenotype.</td>\n",

Pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester screen noting increased risk for Smith-Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and trisomy 18, but karyotype on amniocentesis was normal. As a neonate, she had hyperbilirubinemia treated with phototherapy, elevated liver transaminases and transient thrombocytopenia. In infancy, she had global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, bilateral exotropia, hypotonia, constipation, and intermittent mild lactic acidemia. At age 1 year, she did not make tears when crying, but had adequate tear production to keep her eyes moist. She had intermittent chalazions, but no corneal scarring. She developed staring spells, lasting up to 15 seconds, at approximately age 1 year; these episodes occur about once daily and can be interrupted by gentle contact. By age 17 months she had developed an extrapyramidal movement disorder consisting of asynchronous myoclonic jerks of the limbs and shoulders and subtle choreoathetotic movements of the hands and fingers. At 4 years she can ambulate unassisted, although her gait is unsteady, and communicates with vocalizations, gestures and use of a speech-generating device. 4) Did not carry the c.1201A&gt;T (p.R401X) mutation and their clinical phenotype was relatively mild in comparison 5) WES and whole-genome sequencing were performed using research protocols at Baylor College of Medicine and Stanford University. Mutations in NGLY1 that followed a compound heterozygous inheritance pattern were identified. A stop gain mutation caused by a G&gt;A mutation at position 3:25761670 (hg19) resulting in p.R542X was identified in both the father and daughter. A 3 base pair in-frame deletion TCC&gt; beginning at position 3:25775416 (hg19) was identified in both the mother and daughter. An additional G&gt;T mutation resulting in a heterozygous SMP at position 3:25777564 was identified in the daughter, mother and father. This mutation was not previously observed in 1000 genomes and is a coding region; however, it is present in heterozygous form in all three individuals. 6) A moderate reduction in mitochondrial DNA content was identified in a liver sample 7) Patient 3 does not carry the c.1201A&gt;T (p.R401X) mutation and appears to have a relatively mild phenotype.</td>\n",

       "      <td>1) Sanger sequencing of NGLY1 was performed at Duke University and results were confirmed by a clinical laboratory (GeneDx, Gaithersburg, Maryland). 2) 2 year old, male, Caucasian, no consanguinity, mutations: c.1201A&gt;T(p. R401X)c.1201A&gt;T(pR401X), IUGR, brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, seizures, alacrima/hypolacrima, corneal ulcerations/scarring, chalazions, strabismus, ABR abnormalities, lactic acidosis, neonatal jaundice, elevated liver transaminases, elevated AFP, liver fibrosis, constipation, dysmorphic features, scoliosis, small hands/feet 3) 2-year-old boy, delivered by Cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation after fetal distress was noted on cardiotocography. Pregnancy history was positive for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and oligohydramnios. He had mild hyperbilirubinemia, but otherwise his neonatal course was unremarkable and he was discharged on day of life three. Intermittent head flexion was noted at 6 months, and an EEG at 8 months showed generalized poly-spike discharges. Soon thereafter, mild tonic seizures with head and body flexion started, and evolved to single, symmetric spasms with bilateral arm extension. Involuntary movements of the upper extremities were also noted at this time. In addition, global developmental delay, bilateral ptosis, abnormal tear production, elevated liver transaminases (3 to 4 times upper limit of normal), and constipation were noted in infancy. He has had recurrent episodes of keratoconjunctivitis and poor lid closure during sleep with resultant corneal scarring. 4) Sanger sequencing (Duke University) detected a homozygous nonsense mutation, p.R401X, at position 3:25775422 (hg19) in transcript ENST00000280700. At the cDNA level this is c.1201A&gt;T in exon 8 of NGLY1. This finding was confirmed in a CLIA- certified laboratory (GeneDx). 5) Patient 4 has a homozygous state of the c.1201A&gt;T (p.R401X) mutation. This mutation is associated with a severe phenotype, with outcomes ranging from early demise to living into teenage years.</td>\n",

R401X)/c.1201A&gt;T(p.R401X), IUGR, brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, seizures, alacrima/hypolacrima, elevated liver transaminases, elevated AFP, liver storage or vacuolization, constipation, dysmorphic features, scoliosis 3) Patient 5, a boy, died at the age of 5 years. He was born at term following a pregnancy that was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screening for trisomy 18 and Smith- Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) (AFP 1.97 MoM, uE3 0.24 MoM and hCG 0.48 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal male karyotype and measurement of 7-dehydrocholesterol in amniotic fluid excluded SLOS. He was delivered by Cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation due to concerns for IUGR and a non-reassuring stress test. He had mild flexion contractures of both knees, but had an uneventful neonatal period. He had global developmental delay and constant movements of his arms and legs since early infancy and developed head bobbing at 7 months. At 8 months, liver transaminase elevations (approximately 1.5 times the upper limit of normal) were noted, and the elevations persisted until age 3 1⁄2 years. His reflexes appeared normal in infancy, but were diminished by age 2 years and at 38 months could no longer be elicited. During the second year of life, he was noted to have dry eyes that were treated with lubricant drops at bedtime, and microcephaly was present by 16 months. At 2 1⁄2 years, he developed myoclonic seizures that became intractable despite numerous therapeutic trials. Between the ages of 10 months and five years, he showed slow developmental progress, but regressed during the last year. He died at age 5 years following a viral illness and a prolonged seizure. 4) The variant in NGLY1, single nucleotide variant T&gt; A at position 3:25775422 (hg19), which was called to be homozygous, was present in the mother’s exome as a heterozygous call. This base pair substitution causes a nonsense mutation, R401X. The NGLY1 variant was independently validated by Sanger sequencing in the patient and both parents. 5) Significant brain disease was noted on autopsy, found to have pathological changes consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) 6) Patient 5 has a homozygous state of the c.1201A&gt;T (p.R401X) mutation. This mutation is associated with a severe phenotype, with outcomes ranging from early demise to living into teenage years.</td>\n",

Noted hypotonia, developmental delay and elevated liver transaminases at four months of age. At approximately 4 years of age, observed to have a slight intention tremor and frequent involuntary movements of her neck, hands and arm. At 5 years of age, she was noted to have ocular apraxia, distal tapering of hands and feet, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. She has cortical vision impairment, alacrima and dry eyes that require lubrication, but has not developed corneal scarring. Presently, she has marked intellectual disabilities and requires total care. She has very little expressive speech and communicates through an electronic speech-generating device. She continues to ambulate with a walker. 4) Did not carry the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation and their clinical phenotype was relatively mild in comparison 5) WES (Baylor College of Medicine Whole Genome Laboratory) revealed a homozygous mutation in exon 9 of the NGLY1 gene denoted as c.1370dupG or p.R458fs. Both parents were confirmed to be heterozygous carriers by Sanger sequencing. The mutation causes a frame shift in codon 458, causing insertion of 13 incorrect residues before a stop codon is introduced towards the end of exon 9. The mutation was not seen in any of 3321 other subjects sequenced at Duke, nor was it seen in 6503 subjects on the Exome Variant Server (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA. 6) Patient 2 does not carry the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation and appears to have a relatively mild phenotype.  \n",
       "2  1) Sequenced at Stanford University using both Illumina HiSeq2000 and Complete Genomics platforms. Variants in Illumina-sequenced reads were called using both the Hugeseq and Real Time Genomics pipelines and Complete Genomics variants were identified by their own variant callers. DNA was also capture-sequenced at Baylor College of Medicine using a commercially developed capture reagent (VCRome2). Sequence data were generated on an Illumina HiSeq2000 producing an average coverage of 80× with >90% of targeted bases at 20× coverage or higher. 2) 4 year old, female, Caucasian, no consanguinity, mutations: c.1205_1207del(p.402_403del)/c.1570C>(p. R524X), no IUGR, brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, ocular apraxia, alacrima/hypolacrima, chalazions, strabismus, ABR abnormalities, lactic acidosis, neonatal jaundice, elevated liver transaminases, liver storage or vacuolization, constipation, small hands/feet 3) 4-year-old girl, born via Cesarean section at term for a non-reassuring fetal heart tracing, monitored in the NICU due to poor feeding and lethargy. Pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester screen noting increased risk for Smith-Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and trisomy 18, but karyotype on amniocentesis was normal. As a neonate, she had hyperbilirubinemia treated with phototherapy, elevated liver transaminases and transient thrombocytopenia. In infancy, she had global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, bilateral exotropia, hypotonia, constipation, and intermittent mild lactic acidemia. At age 1 year, she did not make tears when crying, but had adequate tear production to keep her eyes moist. She had intermittent chalazions, but no corneal scarring. She developed staring spells, lasting up to 15 seconds, at approximately age 1 year; these episodes occur about once daily and can be interrupted by gentle contact. By age 17 months she had developed an extrapyramidal movement disorder consisting of asynchronous myoclonic jerks of the limbs and shoulders and subtle choreoathetotic movements of the hands and fingers. At 4 years she can ambulate unassisted, although her gait is unsteady, and communicates with vocalizations, gestures and use of a speech-generating device. 4) Did not carry the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation and their clinical phenotype was relatively mild in comparison 5) WES and whole-genome sequencing were performed using research protocols at Baylor College of Medicine and Stanford University. Mutations in NGLY1 that followed a compound heterozygous inheritance pattern were identified. A stop gain mutation caused by a G>A mutation at position 3:25761670 (hg19) resulting in p.R542X was identified in both the father and daughter. A 3 base pair in-frame deletion TCC> beginning at position 3:25775416 (hg19) was identified in both the mother and daughter. An additional G>T mutation resulting in a heterozygous SMP at position 3:25777564 was identified in the daughter, mother and father. This mutation was not previously observed in 1000 genomes and is a coding region; however, it is present in heterozygous form in all three individuals. 6) A moderate reduction in mitochondrial DNA content was identified in a liver sample 7) Patient 3 does not carry the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation and appears to have a relatively mild phenotype.  \n",

R401X)c.1201A>T(pR401X), IUGR, brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, seizures, alacrima/hypolacrima, corneal ulcerations/scarring, chalazions, strabismus, ABR abnormalities, lactic acidosis, neonatal jaundice, elevated liver transaminases, elevated AFP, liver fibrosis, constipation, dysmorphic features, scoliosis, small hands/feet 3) 2-year-old boy, delivered by Cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation after fetal distress was noted on cardiotocography. Pregnancy history was positive for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and oligohydramnios. He had mild hyperbilirubinemia, but otherwise his neonatal course was unremarkable and he was discharged on day of life three. Intermittent head flexion was noted at 6 months, and an EEG at 8 months showed generalized poly-spike discharges. Soon thereafter, mild tonic seizures with head and body flexion started, and evolved to single, symmetric spasms with bilateral arm extension. Involuntary movements of the upper extremities were also noted at this time. In addition, global developmental delay, bilateral ptosis, abnormal tear production, elevated liver transaminases (3 to 4 times upper limit of normal), and constipation were noted in infancy. He has had recurrent episodes of keratoconjunctivitis and poor lid closure during sleep with resultant corneal scarring. 4) Sanger sequencing (Duke University) detected a homozygous nonsense mutation, p.R401X, at position 3:25775422 (hg19) in transcript ENST00000280700. At the cDNA level this is c.1201A>T in exon 8 of NGLY1. This finding was confirmed in a CLIA- certified laboratory (GeneDx). 5) Patient 4 has a homozygous state of the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation. This mutation is associated with a severe phenotype, with outcomes ranging from early demise to living into teenage years.  \n",

R401X)/c.1201A>T(p.R401X), IUGR, brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, seizures, alacrima/hypolacrima, elevated liver transaminases, elevated AFP, liver storage or vacuolization, constipation, dysmorphic features, scoliosis 3) Patient 5, a boy, died at the age of 5 years. He was born at term following a pregnancy that was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screening for trisomy 18 and Smith- Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) (AFP 1.97 MoM, uE3 0.24 MoM and hCG 0.48 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal male karyotype and measurement of 7-dehydrocholesterol in amniotic fluid excluded SLOS. He was delivered by Cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation due to concerns for IUGR and a non-reassuring stress test. He had mild flexion contractures of both knees, but had an uneventful neonatal period. He had global developmental delay and constant movements of his arms and legs since early infancy and developed head bobbing at 7 months. At 8 months, liver transaminase elevations (approximately 1.5 times the upper limit of normal) were noted, and the elevations persisted until age 3 1⁄2 years. His reflexes appeared normal in infancy, but were diminished by age 2 years and at 38 months could no longer be elicited. During the second year of life, he was noted to have dry eyes that were treated with lubricant drops at bedtime, and microcephaly was present by 16 months. At 2 1⁄2 years, he developed myoclonic seizures that became intractable despite numerous therapeutic trials. Between the ages of 10 months and five years, he showed slow developmental progress, but regressed during the last year. He died at age 5 years following a viral illness and a prolonged seizure. 4) The variant in NGLY1, single nucleotide variant T> A at position 3:25775422 (hg19), which was called to be homozygous, was present in the mother’s exome as a heterozygous call. This base pair substitution causes a nonsense mutation, R401X. The NGLY1 variant was independently validated by Sanger sequencing in the patient and both parents. 5) Significant brain disease was noted on autopsy, found to have pathological changes consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) 6) Patient 5 has a homozygous state of the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation. This mutation is associated with a severe phenotype, with outcomes ranging from early demise to living into teenage years.  "

      "PMC7477955|ALL|1) 12 individuals ages 2 to 21 years with confirmed, biallelic, pathogenic NGLY1 mutations. Clinical features include optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone dystrophy, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, and lower than predicted resting energy expenditure. Laboratory findings include low CSF total protein and albumin, and unusually high antibody titers towards rubella and/or rubeola following vaccination. Confirmed and further quantified previously reported findings noting that decreased tear production, transient transaminitis, small feet, a complex hyperkinetic movement disorder, and varying degrees of global developmental delay with relatively preserved socialization are the most consistent features. 2) NGLY1 deficiency (OMIM: 610661 and 615273), or NGLY1-CDDG, was first reported in 2012 by Need et al., who, through exome sequencing, identified biallelic mutations in the NGLY1 gene as the cause of disease in one child. 3) In 2014, a retrospective chart review highlighted the most common findings in eight known NGLY1-CDDG patients. 4) A natural history study of the disorder was initiated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (trial NCT00369421 and trial NCT02089789). This report documents the results of comprehensive, prospective, clinical, molecular, radiologic, and laboratory investigations performed on 12 affected individuals. 5) Clinical studies were designed to detail the phenotypic features of NGLY1-CDDG. Blood, urine, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), lymphoblasts, and primary dermal fibroblasts were collected, analyzed, and stored. Studies included brain magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI and MRS), routine and overnight electroencephalograms (EEGs) with a limited montage performed during a sleep study, electromyogram (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS), indirect calorimetry, awake and sedated eye examination with Schirmer II testing, optical coherence tomography scans and electroretinography, behavioral determination of pure tone thresholds, tympanometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem evoked potentials (ABR), quantitative sweat analysis autonomic testing (QSWEAT), gastric aspiration, swallow study, skeletal survey, bone age, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), abdominal ultrasound, vibration controlled transient elastography (Fibroscan), echocardiogram, and electrocardiogram. Consultations included clinical neurology, audiology, nutrition, ophthalmology, hepatology, growth, puberty and hormonal studies, allergy and immunology, genetic counseling, physiatry, and speech, occupational, and physical therapy. Eleven individuals underwent developmental psychological evaluations, consisting of at least the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 2nd edition. Cognitive function was assessed with testing specific for age and developmental level that provided either an intelligence quotient (IQ) or developmental quotient (DQ) score. In addition, the Nijmegen pediatric CDG rating scale, a measure of clinical disease progression developed for CDG, was applied to all affected individuals younger than 18 years. 6) Twelve individuals from ten families with confirmed biallelic mutations in NGLY1 were admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. All individuals (six female; six male) were white and ranged from 2.5– 21.3 years of age. We identified 13 different mutations: five missense, five nonsense, two splice site, and one frameshift mutation. The most common mutation was c.1201A>T (p.R401*), occurring in seven alleles. The mutations were widely dispersed along the gene with no obvious hotspot. Only four of the mutations lay within the catalytic domain. 7) Most affected individuals had hypotonic facies, and the features of older individuals reflected their low weight, with thin facies, hollowed cheeks, and visible zygomatic arches. Eye measurements, performed on 10 subjects, varied broadly and revealed no consistent abnormality. 8) Ten of twelve subjects were born at term; two were born at 36 and 34 weeks, respectively. In the majority of individuals, birth weight, length, and occipital-frontal circumference (OFC) were appropriate for gestational age. 9) Individuals grew poorly after mid-childhood, with weight affected more than height. Acquired microcephaly was documented in the four oldest subjects. 10) The total foot length was < 3rd percentile in all 12 individuals. 11) 11 individuals under age 18 years were evaluated using the Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Severity scale. Total Nijmegen scores ranged from 9 (mild) to 52 (severe), with a mean of 28 ± 4 (SEM); the median was 32. 12) There was no significant difference in disease severity of males compared to females. 13) All twelve subjects had at least some developmental delay or intellectual disability, with a broad range of severity. IQ was below average (n=2) or in the range of intellectual disability (n=9) for the entire group; seven individuals had profound intellectual disability. The two individuals with IQ below average were verbally fluent; the remainder were nonverbal (n=7) or used only single words (n=1) or phrase speech (n=1). 14) On the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition, composite scores ranged from 24 to 98 with a mean of 51 (SEM = 7). There was a consistent profile characterized by relatively strong Socialization scores, followed by Communication, and Daily Living Skills. Motor deficits were also reflected in impaired Daily Living Skills scores. Vineland scores were higher than cognitive scores for all subjects. No cross-sectional relationship between age and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite was found. 15) All twelve individuals exhibited hyperkinetic movement disorders that included choreiform, athetoid, dystonic, myoclonic, action tremor, and dysmetric movements and were more severe in the younger individuals. 16) Eleven individuals underwent MRI and MRS of the brain. Clinical assessment of the images was not striking. Delayed myelination was present in three of the four youngest individuals, but all the older individuals had complete myelination. 17) Increased atrophy correlated with worsening of all functional measurements, including IQ or DQ, Vineland assessments, and Nijmegen scores. Brain volume also directly correlated with CSF levels of 5-HIAA, tetrahydrobiopterin, and 5-HVA. 18) N-acetylaspartylglutamate + N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was lower than normal in the left centrum semiovale (LCSO), the midline parietal grey matter (PGM), and superior cerebellar vermis (SVERM). There was a deficit of glutamine + glutamate + gamma-aminobutyric acid (Glx) in the PGM, LCSO, and pons. Choline was higher than expected for age only in the LCSO, and myo-inositol was higher than expected for age in the pons. Multiple correlations between these MRS-measured metabolites and age, functional assessments, brain volume, and neurotransmitters in the CSF were found. The general trend showed that the differences noted above became more pronounced with increasing age, worsening function, and lower brain volume. MRS metabolite measurements did not correlate with total CSF protein, CSF albumin, or CSF/serum albumin ratio. There was a weak correlation between atrophy and total CSF protein, but not CSF albumin or CSF/serum albumin ratio. 19) Nine subjects underwent lumbar puncture. CSF total protein and albumin concentrations, as well as the CSF/serum albumin ratios, were low in nearly all individuals. There was no correlation between age and CSF protein or albumin levels. CSF 5-HIAA, HVA, and BH4 levels strongly and directly correlated with brain atrophy. CSF lactate and amino acid levels were essentially normal. CSF leucocyte counts (0–4; normal 0–5), glucose concentrations (54–72 mg/dL; normal 40–70), 3-O-methyldopa concentrations (12–28 nM; normal <150) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations (45– 85 nmol/L; normal 40–150) were unremarkable. 20) Neopterin levels were normal but decreased with age, and CSF tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels were below the lower limit of normal in all but one subject tested; however, there was no correlation with age. 21) Nerve conduction studies were performed in 11 individuals. The predominant finding was an axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (n=8) with additional demyelinative features (n=6). Results of neurophysiological testing demonstrated a length- dependent, progressive loss of sensory and motor axons and sympathetic nerve function, apparently static abnormalities in myelination of peripheral nerves, and possible motor neuron degeneration. 22) QSWEATs were performed in 11 individuals, abnormal results were found in 8 individuals who also had axonal sensorimotor neuropathies. The distal lower extremity QSWEAT was more frequently absent (7/11) compared to the forearm (1/11), indicating a length dependent neuropathy. There was a trend to greater severity of neuropathy in the older individuals, with an inverse correlation between tibial motor amplitude and age (p = 0.002, r2 = 0.799); the amplitude decreased by −0.3 mV per year (normal, >+2.5mV per year). 23) Awake and sedated ophthalmic examinations were performed on 11 study participants. Observed conditions include Lagophthalmous, ptosis, exotropia and/or esotropia, corneal neovascularization, pannus formation or scarring, optic nerve pallor or atrophy, retinal. 24) All individuals had evidence of hypo- or complete alacrima on Schirmer II testing. Tear production did not correlate with age. Pigmentary changes including pigment granularity and pigmentary retinopathy or pigmentary changes, blonde or poorly pigmented retinal periphery, and refractive errors were observed. 25) Audiologic assessments, including otoacoustic emissions and/or cochlear microphonics to evaluate for the functional integrity of the inner ear, and auditory brainstem response (ABRs), were conducted on 11 subjects. Behavioral hearing thresholds could be established reliably in only three subjects and all had normal hearing sensitivity. Tympanometry was unremarkable. Most remarkable was the dyssynchronous and/or absent transmission through the auditory brainstem and/or 8th nerve in most individuals. The severity of the transmission abnormality through the auditory brainstem increased with increasing age, and the eighth nerve was bilaterally involved the 4 oldest individuals. 26) Clinical feeding and modified barium swallow assessments were performed on 11 subjects. Oral motor deficits, including persistent nutritive suckle swallow and poor oral bolus formation, were present in 10 of 11. Premature spillage and pharyngeal swallow response delays remained the primary deficits of all subjects. No aspiration or laryngeal penetration for any textures were observed in the swallow studies. Developmental delays in mastication were evident and characterized by munching patterns without matured rotary chewing of solid textures. Generalized weakness of the lips and tongue was observed in all individuals during cranial nerve assessments. Dystonic movements of the tongue and persistent oral reflexes of suckling and suck/swallows were seen in the majority of individuals. 27) Echocardiograms were unremarkable 28) Electrocardiograms showed heart rates in the low 100s 29) No associations between age and either sleep apnea or frequent periodic limb movements 30) Gastric pH was assessed after H2 blockers and osmotic pump inhibitors had been discontinued for 5 days. Gastric pH was appropriately acidic in all individuals tested except one, whose pH was 7.25. 31) No hydronephrosis, polycystic kidneys, horseshoe kidneys, kidney calculi, nephrocalcinosis, or perinephric fluid were seen. 32) Laboratory values reflecting gastrointestinal and hepatic function were essentially normal at the time of the NIH evaluation. 33) One individual had undergone liver transplantation for presumed hepatocellular carcinoma. 34) These transaminase levels normalized around age 4. 35) Circulating proteins were normal or borderline low in all individuals. 36) Total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides were also low. 37) Hematologic profiles showed unremarkable complete blood counts 38) Coagulation studies showed normal prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) 39) All factors except for Antithrombin III were lower in individuals with the c.1201A>T mutation 40) Seven of 11 individuals tested exhibited out of range elevations in antibody titers towards rubella and/or rubeola following MMR vaccination. Biochemical markers known to be abnormal in mitochondropathies and hypoglycosylation disorders showed inconsistent results. 41) Bone age was delayed in eight of the 11 subjects tested without any consistent abnormalities of the endocrine system: the somatotropic axis and thyroid function were normal in all studied individuals. 42) Femoral bone density was low in all nine individuals who underwent DEXA scanning (mean, SEM z-scores for 8 patients < 21 years adjacent to the growth plate = −3, 0.4; metaphysis-diaphysis = −2.2, 0.6, and diaphysis = −1.8, 0.5). 43) All subjects had joint hypermobility except the older ones, who had contractures in both small and large joints. 44) Complete skeletal surveys were performed on 11 individuals; abnormalities included coxa valga (n=11), scoliosis (n=6), growth arrest lines or metaphyseal banding without palmidronate treatment (n=4), dislocations or subluxations involving the hips and shoulder joints (n=3), and sclerosis of the phalanges or tarsal bones (n=2). 45) Findings noted only once included flexion deformity of the fingers, hallux valgus, sclerotic lesion of the distal femur, thinning of the fibulas, prominent apophyseal bone formation in the ileac crests and ischia, ulnar bowing, expansion of the cortexes in the proximal and middle phalanges in digits 2–4, widened phalanges, and shortened and widened metatarsals. 46) Our prospective investigations into NGLY1-CDDG revealed several new discoveries associated with this disorder. These included low CSF total protein and albumin, optic atrophy and retinal pigmentary changes/cone dystrophy, poor weight gain starting in mid- childhood, lower than predicted resting energy expenditure, central and obstructive sleep apnea, delayed bone age, joint hypermobility, progressive brain atrophy, abnormalities in brain MRS-measured metabolites, various abnormalities on skeletal survey, high antibody titers after rubella and rubeola vaccination, and low levels of several pro- and anti- coagulation factors. Echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and CSF lactate levels were normal. 47) Patients showed global developmental delay, movement disorder, frequent seizure disorder, hypotonia, hypolacrima or alacrima, corneal disease, ptosis, lagophthalmous, strabismus, peripheral neuropathy and occasional diminished reflexes, hypohidrosis, auditory brainstem response abnormalities, abnormal brain imaging, scoliosis, acquired microcephaly, small hands and feet, dysmorphic features, constipation, elevated liver enzymes present only early in childhood, osteopenia, and hypocholesterolemia associated with NGLY1-CDDG. Transient elastography results showed minimal if any fibrosis. No abnormal storage material was observed in the three liver biopsy specimens analyzed, nor was ocular apraxia observed, despite performing detailed ophthalmologic evaluations that involved some subjects previously reported to have ocular apraxia. 48) Patients considered for NGLY1-CDDG differential diagnosis due to the tetrad of developmental delay/intellectual disability, hyperkinetic movement disorder, hypolacrima, and a history of elevated transaminases during early childhood. 49) Patients have auditory neural pathway dysfunction without peripheral hearing loss, resembling auditory neuropathy. They experience difficulty hearing in the presence of background noise and benefit from quiet listening environments. If hypohidrosis is detected, preventative measures (hydration, ventilation, etc.) against situations that cause dangerous core body hyperthermia can be taken. It is important to aggressively manage hypo-lacrima with artificial tears and bland ointment to prevent secondary complications that can impact vision. They have disordered mastication for solids but a functional ability to swallow, suggesting the need for oral motor and swallowing therapies to facilitate better control and chewing maturation. 50) Patients have low Motor Skills scores and Daily Living Skills scores due to significant motor involvement required for daily tasks. They have a hyperkinetic movement disorder due to NGLY1-CDDG. This disorder may be caused by myoclonic seizures, neurotransmitter deficiency, and/or peripheral neuropathy manifesting as sensory ataxia. 51) Results from MRS showed that as functional impairment worsened and age increased, NAA decreased, while choline, myo-inositol and creatine increased. Additionally, creatine and myoinositol were inversely correlated, and NAA directly correlated, with neurotransmitter levels (5-HIAA, 5-HVA, 3-OMD, and neopterin). NAA may be found exclusively in neurons and declines as neurons become unhealthy or die. Elevations in choline could be consistent with a relative abundance of glial cells secondary to neuronal loss. Myo-inositol is a glia-specific marker that is elevated by gliosis or inflammation; in our cohort we do not have any evidence of inflammation. Creatine levels are relatively higher in glial cells compared to neurons. The MRS findings suggest that there is a relative abundance of glial cells compared to neurons in the brain of NGLY1-CDDG individuals, possibly due to loss of neurons, and that the degree of this imbalance contributes significantly to the severity of the phenotype. 52) Individuals with NGLY1-CDDG share phenotypic features of low cholesterol, hepatopathy, peripheral neuropathy, retinal and optic nerve abnormalities, seizures, developmental delay with socialization as a relative strength, and delayed bone age. They also exhibit hypolacrima, a feature shared with O-linked glycosylation disorders. N-glycanase 1, which catalyzes the cleavage of the amide bond between the proximal N-acetylglucosamine residue of glycans and the asparagine residue of the protein, may be pathogenically related to NGLY1-CDDG. This could impair glycan recycling and lead to hypoglycosylation. Subtle abnormalities in transferrin and ApoC-III glycosylation were observed in these individuals. 53) Preliminary experiments found no impairment or enhancement of standard ERAD marker expression under normal conditions in NGLY1-CDDG patient fibroblasts. 54) NGLY1-CDDG is a progressive disorder. The Nijmegen severity scores and Vineland scores indicated worsening function with age. Also progressive were the peripheral neuropathy, auditory neural dysfunction, scoliosis, inability to maintain weight, brain atrophy on MRI, abnormalities in brain metabolites measured on MRS, and CSF neurotransmitter levels. Hypolacrima occurred at all ages, and the hepatopathy and hyperkinetic movement disorder appeared to improve with age. 55) This study reports on several mutations of the NGLY1 gene. The mutations include NM_018297.3:c.931G>A, NM_018297.3:c.1604G>A, NM_018297.3:c.622C>T, NM_018297.3:c.347C>G, NM_018297.3:c.1169G>C, NM_018297.3:c.730T>C, NM_018297.3:c.1910delT, NM_018297.3:c.930C>T, NM_018297.3:c.881+5G>T. Four of these mutations lie within the catalytic domain (amino acid residues 292–353);, i.e., c.730T>C, c.953T>C, c.931G>A, and c.930C> T. The study does not provide specific information about individual patients, their phenotypes, physical or behavioral traits, demographics, lab measurements, treatments, or family histories. 56) Individuals with NGLY1-CDDG have facial features including upturned nasal tip, hypotonic facies, ptosis, brachycephaly, thinned facies, hollowed cheeks, and visible zygomatic arches. Interpupillary distance ranged from the 13–95 centiles with the mean at the 66th centile, and SEM of 8. Horizontal fissure length ranged from 3–70 centiles with mean at the 20th centile, and SEM of 1. Inner canthal distance ranged from 3–100 centiles with the mean at the 59th centile and SEM of 10. Outer canthal distance ranged from 6–81 centile with mean at the 43 centile and SEM of 7. Canthal index ranged from −2 to +2 SD from the normal mean. 57) Right eye close-up showing conjunctival injection, limbal neovascularization, and corneal scarring in an NGLY1 patient. Findings caused by severe dry eyes and lagophthalmous.\n",

      "PMC4243708|1|1) Exome sequencing was performed at Duke University using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform and the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon 50 Mb Kit. 2) 5 year old, male, Caucasian, no consanguinity, mutations: c.C1891del (p.Q631S)/c.1201A>T(p.R401X), no IUGR, brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, seizures, alacrima/hypolacrima, corneal ulcerations/scarring, chalazions, elevated liver transaminases, elevated AFP, liver fibrosis, liver storage or vacuolization, constipation, small hands/feet, peripheral neuropathy 3) 5-year-old male, presented in the neonatal period with involuntary movements, including athetosis involving the trunk and extremities and constant lip smacking and pursing while awake. Pregnancy and birth history were unremarkable. He had mild neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy, but otherwise appeared well. Global developmental delay, hypotonia, intractable multifocal epilepsy, consisting of myoclonic seizures, drop attacks, and staring or tonic episodes, and liver disease were present in infancy. He has cortical vision loss and congenital alacrima and corneal ulcerations with scarring were noted at age 4 years. Now, at age 5 years, the movement disorder has not abated and he has central hypotonia and global developmental delay. 4) Whole exome sequencing (WES) performed as part of a research protocol detected putative knock out mutations forming a compound heterozygote genotype in the NGLY1 gene (Maternal frameshift: Q631S. at cDNA level: C1891del in transcript ENST00000280700. EXON 12. Paternal nonsense: 3_25750426_A, which causes a nonsense mutation, R401X, in transcript ENST00000280700. At the cDNA level this is A1201T EXON 8) 5) Patient 1 has a compound heterozygous state of the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation.\n",
      "PMC4243708|2|1) WES was performed on a clinical basis at Baylor College of Medicine Whole Genome Laboratory, Houston, Texas. 2) 20 year old, female, Caucasian, consanguinity, mutations: c.1370dupG(p.R458fs)/c.1370dupG(p.R458fs), IUGR, no brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, ocular apraxia, alacrima/hypolacrima, corneal ulcerations/scarring, elevated liver transaminases, liver storage or vacuolization, constipation, scoliosis, peripheral neuropathy 3) 20-year-old female, born at 39 weeks of gestation via Cesarean section due to intrauterine growth retardation and an abnormal appearing placenta. Noted hypotonia, developmental delay and elevated liver transaminases at four months of age. At approximately 4 years of age, observed to have a slight intention tremor and frequent involuntary movements of her neck, hands and arm. At 5 years of age, she was noted to have ocular apraxia, distal tapering of hands and feet, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. She has cortical vision impairment, alacrima and dry eyes that require lubrication, but has not developed corneal scarring. Presently, she has marked intellectual disabilities and requires total care. She has very little expressive speech and communicates through an electronic speech-generating device. She continues to ambulate with a walker. 4) Did not carry the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation and their clinical phenotype was relatively mild in comparison 5) WES (Baylor College of Medicine Whole Genome Laboratory) revealed a homozygous mutation in exon 9 of the NGLY1 gene denoted as c.1370dupG or p.R458fs. Both parents were confirmed to be heterozygous carriers by Sanger sequencing. The mutation causes a frame shift in codon 458, causing insertion of 13 incorrect residues before a stop codon is introduced towards the end of exon 9. The mutation was not seen in any of 3321 other subjects sequenced at Duke, nor was it seen in 6503 subjects on the Exome Variant Server (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA. 6) Patient 2 does not carry the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation and appears to have a relatively mild phenotype.\n",
      "PMC4243708|3|1) Sequenced at Stanford University using both Illumina HiSeq2000 and Complete Genomics platforms. Variants in Illumina-sequenced reads were called using both the Hugeseq and Real Time Genomics pipelines and Complete Genomics variants were identified by their own variant callers. DNA was also capture-sequenced at Baylor College of Medicine using a commercially developed capture reagent (VCRome2). Sequence data were generated on an Illumina HiSeq2000 producing an average coverage of 80× with >90% of targeted bases at 20× coverage or higher. 2) 4 year old, female, Caucasian, no consanguinity, mutations: c.1205_1207del(p.402_403del)/c.1570C>(p. R524X), no IUGR, brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, ocular apraxia, alacrima/hypolacrima, chalazions, strabismus, ABR abnormalities, lactic acidosis, neonatal jaundice, elevated liver transaminases, liver storage or vacuolization, constipation, small hands/feet 3) 4-year-old girl, born via Cesarean section at term for a non-reassuring fetal heart tracing, monitored in the NICU due to poor feeding and lethargy. Pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester screen noting increased risk for Smith-Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and trisomy 18, but karyotype on amniocentesis was normal. As a neonate, she had hyperbilirubinemia treated with phototherapy, elevated liver transaminases and transient thrombocytopenia. In infancy, she had global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, bilateral exotropia, hypotonia, constipation, and intermittent mild lactic acidemia. At age 1 year, she did not make tears when crying, but had adequate tear production to keep her eyes moist. She had intermittent chalazions, but no corneal scarring. She developed staring spells, lasting up to 15 seconds, at approximately age 1 year; these episodes occur about once daily and can be interrupted by gentle contact. By age 17 months she had developed an extrapyramidal movement disorder consisting of asynchronous myoclonic jerks of the limbs and shoulders and subtle choreoathetotic movements of the hands and fingers. At 4 years she can ambulate unassisted, although her gait is unsteady, and communicates with vocalizations, gestures and use of a speech-generating device. 4) Did not carry the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation and their clinical phenotype was relatively mild in comparison 5) WES and whole-genome sequencing were performed using research protocols at Baylor College of Medicine and Stanford University. Mutations in NGLY1 that followed a compound heterozygous inheritance pattern were identified. A stop gain mutation caused by a G>A mutation at position 3:25761670 (hg19) resulting in p.R542X was identified in both the father and daughter. A 3 base pair in-frame deletion TCC> beginning at position 3:25775416 (hg19) was identified in both the mother and daughter. An additional G>T mutation resulting in a heterozygous SMP at position 3:25777564 was identified in the daughter, mother and father. This mutation was not previously observed in 1000 genomes and is a coding region; however, it is present in heterozygous form in all three individuals. 6) A moderate reduction in mitochondrial DNA content was identified in a liver sample 7) Patient 3 does not carry the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation and appears to have a relatively mild phenotype.\n",
      "PMC4243708|4|1) Sanger sequencing of NGLY1 was performed at Duke University and results were confirmed by a clinical laboratory (GeneDx, Gaithersburg, Maryland). 2) 2 year old, male, Caucasian, no consanguinity, mutations: c.1201A>T(p. R401X)c.1201A>T(pR401X), IUGR, brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, seizures, alacrima/hypolacrima, corneal ulcerations/scarring, chalazions, strabismus, ABR abnormalities, lactic acidosis, neonatal jaundice, elevated liver transaminases, elevated AFP, liver fibrosis, constipation, dysmorphic features, scoliosis, small hands/feet 3) 2-year-old boy, delivered by Cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation after fetal distress was noted on cardiotocography. Pregnancy history was positive for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and oligohydramnios. He had mild hyperbilirubinemia, but otherwise his neonatal course was unremarkable and he was discharged on day of life three. Intermittent head flexion was noted at 6 months, and an EEG at 8 months showed generalized poly-spike discharges. Soon thereafter, mild tonic seizures with head and body flexion started, and evolved to single, symmetric spasms with bilateral arm extension. Involuntary movements of the upper extremities were also noted at this time. In addition, global developmental delay, bilateral ptosis, abnormal tear production, elevated liver transaminases (3 to 4 times upper limit of normal), and constipation were noted in infancy. He has had recurrent episodes of keratoconjunctivitis and poor lid closure during sleep with resultant corneal scarring. 4) Sanger sequencing (Duke University) detected a homozygous nonsense mutation, p.R401X, at position 3:25775422 (hg19) in transcript ENST00000280700. At the cDNA level this is c.1201A>T in exon 8 of NGLY1. This finding was confirmed in a CLIA- certified laboratory (GeneDx). 5) Patient 4 has a homozygous state of the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation. This mutation is associated with a severe phenotype, with outcomes ranging from early demise to living into teenage years.\n",
      "PMC4243708|5|1) Exome sequencing was performed at University of British Columbia using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform and the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon 50 Mb Kit. 2) 0.5 year old, male, Caucasian, no consanguinity, mutations: c.1201A>T(p. R401X)/c.1201A>T(p.R401X), IUGR, brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, seizures, alacrima/hypolacrima, elevated liver transaminases, elevated AFP, liver storage or vacuolization, constipation, dysmorphic features, scoliosis 3) Patient 5, a boy, died at the age of 5 years. He was born at term following a pregnancy that was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screening for trisomy 18 and Smith- Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) (AFP 1.97 MoM, uE3 0.24 MoM and hCG 0.48 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal male karyotype and measurement of 7-dehydrocholesterol in amniotic fluid excluded SLOS. He was delivered by Cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation due to concerns for IUGR and a non-reassuring stress test. He had mild flexion contractures of both knees, but had an uneventful neonatal period. He had global developmental delay and constant movements of his arms and legs since early infancy and developed head bobbing at 7 months. At 8 months, liver transaminase elevations (approximately 1.5 times the upper limit of normal) were noted, and the elevations persisted until age 3 1⁄2 years. His reflexes appeared normal in infancy, but were diminished by age 2 years and at 38 months could no longer be elicited. During the second year of life, he was noted to have dry eyes that were treated with lubricant drops at bedtime, and microcephaly was present by 16 months. At 2 1⁄2 years, he developed myoclonic seizures that became intractable despite numerous therapeutic trials. Between the ages of 10 months and five years, he showed slow developmental progress, but regressed during the last year. He died at age 5 years following a viral illness and a prolonged seizure. 4) The variant in NGLY1, single nucleotide variant T> A at position 3:25775422 (hg19), which was called to be homozygous, was present in the mother’s exome as a heterozygous call. This base pair substitution causes a nonsense mutation, R401X. The NGLY1 variant was independently validated by Sanger sequencing in the patient and both parents. 5) Significant brain disease was noted on autopsy, found to have pathological changes consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) 6) Patient 5 has a homozygous state of the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation. This mutation is associated with a severe phenotype, with outcomes ranging from early demise to living into teenage years.\n",
      "PMC4243708|6|1) Exome sequencing was performed at University of British Columbia using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform and the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon 50 Mb Kit.

R401X)/c.1201A>T(p.R401X), IUGR, brain imaging abnormalities, global developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, movement disorder, EEG abnormalities, decreased DTRs, alacrima/hypolacrima, elevated liver transaminases, liver storage or vacuolization, constipation 3) Patient 6 is the younger sister of Subject 5. The pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screen for trisomy 18 and SLOS (AFP 0.87 MoM, uE3 0.31 MoM, hCG 0.57 MoM). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal female karyotype. She was delivered by Cesarean section at 35 weeks of gestation following an ultrasound that was concerning for IUGR. She had jaundice requiring phototherapy, but her course in the nursery was otherwise uneventful. By age 9 months, developmental delay was apparent and she had developed hypotonia, microcephaly, a mildly myopathic- appearing face and constant involuntary movements with a tendency to hyperextend her arms and close her fists. At 9 1⁄2 months of age, she died unexpectedly in her sleep and the cause of death remains unknown. 4) The variant in NGLY1, single nucleotide variant T> A at position 3:25775422 (hg19), which was called to be homozygous, was present in the mother’s exome as a heterozygous call. This base pair substitution causes a nonsense mutation, R401X.

Prenatal history was significant for IUGR. Had cyanosis at birth and required resuscitation. Anal stenosis requiring dilatation was noted in the first week of life. Noted to have hypotonia, a movement disorder consisting of head bobbing and extremity athetosis, and developmental delay in early infancy. At 3 years, she could stand unsupported, ambulate with a walker, and started to babble. Seizures developed at age 11 years and she lost all mobility. Other medical history includes acquired microcephaly, an inability to close her eyes completely during sleep, chronic conjunctivitis, corneal clouding, hypolacrima, strabismus, hearing impairment, gastro-esophageal reflux, chronic constipation, severe scoliosis and talipes equinovarus. 3) WES detected a homozygous nonsense mutation, R401X, at position 3:25775422 (hg19) in transcript ENST00000280700. At the cDNA level this is c.1201A>T in exon 8 of NGLY1. 4) Patient 8 has a homozygous state of the c.1201A>T (p.R401X) mutation. This mutation is associated with a severe phenotype, with outcomes ranging from early demise to living into teenage years.\n",
      "PMC4243708|ALL|1) All patients had global developmental delay, a movement disorder, and hypotonia. 2) The most common deleterious allele was the nonsense mutation c.1201A>T (p.R401X). 3) Seven newly diagnosed patients with mutations in NGLY1. These observations confirm NGLY1 deficiency as an inherited disorder associated with the ERAD process and document its clinical presentation. 4) All patients had global developmental delay, a movement disorder, and hypotonia. Other common findings included hypo- or alacrima (7/8), abnormal brain imaging (7/8), EEG abnormalities (7/8), elevated liver transaminases (6/7), microcephaly (6/8), diminished reflexes (6/8), hepatocyte cytoplasmic storage material or vacuolization (5/6), seizures (4/8), and abnormal nerve conduction (3/3). Two of the patients died prematurely at 9 months and 5 years of age. 5) The nonsense mutation c.1201A>T (p.R401X) was the most common deleterious allele identified, present in homozygous state in 5 of 8 cases and in compound heterozygous state in one case. 6) Patients have compound heterozygous knockout mutations in NGLY1. They have a clinical triad consisting of abnormal tear production, choreoathetosis and liver disease. Other common findings include global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, hypotonia, EEG abnormalities with or without overt seizures, brain imaging abnormalities, a peripheral neuropathy, constipation and a history of IUGR. Some patients were noted to have dysmorphic features. Low uE3 was present in three patients, including in two children who died and were found to have significant adrenal cortex vacuolation. Adrenal function was not specifically evaluated in our patients, some degree of dysfunction remains possible. 7) Patients commonly had abnormalities detected on brain imaging, but findings were typically mild and non-specific. The combination of hypo- or alacrima and a movement disorder consisting of tremulousness and varying degrees of choreoathetosis appear to be pathognomonic for NGLY1 deficiency. Unlike CDGs, NGLY1 deficiency does not appear to be associated with cerebellar atrophy, lipodystrophy, or significant heart manifestations. Lactic acidemia was variably present, but tended to be mild; chronic elevations were not noted in any patient. 8) No specific patient information is provided. However, it is mentioned that patients with mutations in MAN1B1, the gene coding for α-1,2-mannosidase, are associated with non-syndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability and subtle dysmorphic features. α-1,2-Mannosidase is a type II transmembrane protein that is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it undergoes O-glycosylation and participates in glycoprotein quality control. 9) Patients with autosomal recessive mutations in ERLIN2 present profound intellectual disability, developmental regression and multiple contractures. Abnormal erlin2 causes impaired ERAD of activated inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3) and other substrates by compromising the structure of the erlin1/2 complex. Despite the severity of the intellectual disability and neuromuscular findings, the results of brain imaging, electromyography and muscle biopsy appeared normal in these patients. 10) A family was found to have a homozygous null mutation in ERLIN2, with affected individuals presenting with a hereditary spastic paraplegia phenotype. 11) NGLY1 deficiency results in accumulation of intact glycoproteins in the cytoplasm. Three patients showed accumulation of an amorphous substance in the liver, and two others showed vacuolization consistent with storage, which may explain the liver disease noted in these patients. The undefined stored substance likely represents accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins in the cytoplasm that have been retrotranslocated from the ER but cannot undergo further processing. Transferrin isoelectric focusing or mass spectrometry studies in NGLY1-deficient patients have been normal or only subtly abnormal. 12) Patients have axonal loss and gliosis in the brains suggestive of HIE, indicating that NGLY1 plays a role in maintaining central nervous system integrity. They also seem to have peripheral neuropathy that is relatively common in NGLY1 deficiency. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying pathogenesis of both central and peripheral nervous system abnormalities. 13) NGLY1 deficiency is characterized by unique features including elevation of AFP and liver enzymes in infancy with relative normalization in early childhood, accumulation of a substance with staining properties similar to glycogen in hepatocyte cytoplasm, absent tears resulting in blepharitis and corneal ulceration, a movement disorder and peripheral neuropathy. The transient nature of the AFP and liver transaminase elevation may make older or more mildly affected individuals difficult to detect.\n",

    "Seven of twelve subjects had clinical seizures, and one had subclinical seizures recognized on previous EEG. Details regarding age of onset, seizure type and frequency, medications, and EEG findings are noted in Supplementary Table S. On overnight EEG, only one individual (#6) had active seizures recorded, but seven had multifocal epileptiform activity. There were no age or genotype differences between individuals having seizures and those without. In fact, in each sibling pair, one had seizures and the other did not.\n",
    "All twelve individuals exhibited hyperkinetic movement disorders that included choreiform, athetoid, dystonic, myoclonic, action tremor, and dysmetric movements and were more severe in the younger individuals (Supplementary Movie S1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Brain MRI and MRS\n",
    "Eleven individuals underwent MRI and MRS of the brain. Clinical assessment of the images was not striking (Figure 3). Delayed myelination was present in three of the four youngest individuals, but all the older individuals had complete myelination. Six of nine individuals had qualitatively-evident cerebral atrophy that ranged from slight to moderate. Four individuals (#1, #2, #6, #10) also had slight cerebellar atrophy. The atrophy tended to be greater in the older individuals (p=0.17, Supplementary Figure S3), and in one teenager (#11) follow-up imaging showed atrophy measurably worse after a 20-month interval (net loss of 34 cm3 relative to expected). Increased atrophy correlated with worsening of all functional measurements (Supplementary Figure S3), including IQ or DQ (p<0.03), Vineland assessments (p<0.03), and Nijmegen scores (p=0.01). Brain volume also directly correlated with CSF levels of 5-HIAA (p=0.03), tetrahydrobiopterin (p=0.02), and 5-HVA (p=0.06) (Supplementary Figure S3).\n",
