There was a deficit of glutamine + glutamate + gamma-aminobutyric acid (Glx) in the PGM (p=0.03), LCSO (p=0.01), and pons (p=0.0002). Choline was higher than expected for age only in the LCSO (p=0.0097), and myo-inositol was higher than expected for age in the pons (p=0.002). Multiple correlations between these MRS-measured metabolites and age, functional assessments, brain volume, and neurotransmitters in the CSF were found. The general trend showed that the differences noted above became more pronounced with increasing age, worsening function, and lower brain volume. MRS metabolite measurements did not correlate with total CSF protein, CSF albumin, or CSF/serum albumin ratio. There was a weak correlation (p=0.09) between atrophy and total CSF protein, but not CSF albumin or CSF/serum albumin ratio.  \n",

The atrophy also correlated with CSF metabolites (BH4, 5-HIAA, HVA), which are known to be lower when there is damage to neurotransmitter producing neurons. This suggests that these biochemical abnormalities may be secondary to brain atrophy.  "

Pregnancy history was positive for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and oligohydramnios. He had mild hyperbilirubinemia, but otherwise his neonatal course was unremarkable and he was discharged on day of life three. Intermittent head flexion was noted at 6 months, and an EEG at 8 months showed generalized poly-spike discharges. Soon thereafter, mild tonic seizures with head and body flexion started, and evolved to single, symmetric spasms with bilateral arm extension. Involuntary movements of the upper extremities were also noted at this time. In addition, global developmental delay, bilateral ptosis, abnormal tear production, elevated liver transaminases (3 to 4 times upper limit of normal), and constipation were noted in infancy.

Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal female karyotype. She was delivered by Cesarean section at 35 weeks of gestation following an ultrasound that was concerning for IUGR. She had jaundice requiring phototherapy, but her course in the nursery was otherwise uneventful. By age 9 months, developmental delay was apparent and she had developed hypotonia, microcephaly, a mildly myopathic- appearing face and constant involuntary movements with a tendency to hyperextend her arms and close her fists.

      "- Patient 3 is a 4-year-old girl who was born via Cesarean section at term due to a non-reassuring fetal heart tracing. She was monitored in the NICU due to poor feeding and lethargy. Her pregnancy was complicated by a positive second trimester screen noting increased risk for Smith-Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and trisomy 18, but karyotype on amniocentesis was normal. As a neonate, she had hyperbilirubinemia that was treated with phototherapy and was noted to have elevated liver transaminases and transient thrombocytopenia. In infancy, she was noted to have global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, bilateral exotropia, hypotonia, constipation, and intermittent mild lactic acidemia. At approximately age 1 year, the parents noticed that she did not make tears when crying, although she had adequate tear production to keep her eyes moist. She has had intermittent chalazions, but no corneal scarring. She also developed staring spells, lasting up to 15 seconds, at approximately age 1 year; these episodes occur about once daily and can be interrupted by gentle contact. By age 17 months she had developed an extrapyramidal movement disorder consisting of asynchronous myoclonic jerks of the limbs and shoulders and subtle choreoathetotic movements of the hands and fingers. At 4 years she can ambulate unassisted, although her gait is unsteady, and communicates with vocalizations, gestures and use of a speech-generating device.\n",
      "- Patient 5, a boy, died at the age of 5 years. He was born at term following a pregnancy that was complicated by a positive second trimester serum screening for trisomy 18 and Smith- Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS). Cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes showed a normal male karyotype and measurement of 7-dehydrocholesterol in amniotic fluid excluded SLOS. He was delivered by Cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation due to concerns for IUGR and a non-reassuring stress test. He had mild flexion contractures of both knees, but had an uneventful neonatal period. He had global developmental delay and constant movements of his arms and legs since early infancy and developed head bobbing at 7 months. At 8 months, liver transaminase elevations (approximately 1.5 times the upper limit of normal) were noted, and the elevations persisted until age 3 1⁄2 years. His reflexes appeared normal in infancy, but were diminished by age 2 years and at 38 months could no longer be elicited. During the second year of life, he was noted to have dry eyes that were treated with lubricant drops at bedtime, and microcephaly was present by 16 months. At 2 1⁄2 years, he developed myoclonic seizures that became intractable despite numerous therapeutic trials. Between the ages of 10 months and five years, he showed slow developmental progress, but regressed during the last year. He died at age 5 years following a viral illness and a prolonged seizure.\n",

      "- Significant brain disease was noted on autopsy in Patient 5 who was found to have pathological changes consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).\n",
      "- Patient 12 has peripheral neuropathy (PN) in sensory and motor nerves, not recordable conduction velocity (CV), connective tissue replacement of muscle, some active and chronic neurogenic findings, and present QSWEAT findings in arm but absent in ankle.\n",
      "- Patient 2, a now 20-year-old female, was born at 39 weeks of gestation via Cesarean section because of intrauterine growth retardation and an abnormal appearing placenta. At four months of age, hypotonia, developmental delay and elevated liver transaminases were noted. At approximately 4 years of age, a slight intention tremor and frequent involuntary movements of her neck, hands and arm were observed. At 5 years of age, she was noted to have ocular apraxia, distal tapering of hands and feet, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. She has cortical vision impairment, as well as alacrima and dry eyes that require lubrication, but has not developed corneal scarring. Presently, she has marked intellectual disabilities and requires total care. She has very little expressive speech and communicates through an electronic speech-generating device. She continues to ambulate with a walker.\n",
      "- Patient 8 has normal sensory and motor nerves, borderline slow conduction velocity (CV), mild chronic neurogenic findings, and present quantitative sweat analysis (QSWEAT) findings in both arm and ankle.\n",
      "- Patient 7 is a 3-year-old girl, born at term via scheduled Cesarean section. She had mild jaundice at birth but no other neonatal complications. Prenatal screen showed an increased risk for trisomy 21. In infancy, she was noted to have strabismus, hypotonia, athetoid arm and hand movements, clasped hands, and elevated liver transaminases (approximately 3 times upper limit of normal). Microcephaly was present by age 2 years. Severe developmental delay was present, but she has shown slow progress without regression. She learned to sit alone and started to crawl at 2 years, but had no words.\n",
      "- Patient 7 has a homozygous nonsense mutation, R401X, at position 3:25775422 (hg19) in transcript ENST00000280700. At the cDNA level this is c.1201A>T in exon 8 of NGLY1.\n",

      "- Patient 3 has Protein level of 12 mg/dL, Albumin level of 8 mg/dL, CSF/serum Albumin quotient of 2.4, 5HIAA level of 83 nM, HVA level of 206 nM, Neopterin level of 17 nM, BH4 level of 8 nM, Lactate level of 1.3 mM, and Glycine in Amino acids.\n",
      "- Handwriting elicits jerky irregular hand movements. Finger-nose-finger testing is accomplished with an irregular tremulous trajectory. During this phase of the exam, a brief seizure is captured with associated behavioral arrest and tonic upward deviation of her eyes lasting a few seconds. Rapid finger movements are slow and irregular but her gait is not ataxic. Myoclonus (positive and negative) are evident when holding her arms against gravity.\n",
      "- Distal upper and lower extremities have developed a flexion contracture at the hands and feet. Irregular action-induced jerking movements are elicited while reaching. Gaze is conjugate. Visual pursuit is normal and there is generalized arreflexia. Muscle wasting notable throughout, especially in the lower extremities likely secondary to peripheral neuropathy.\n",
      "- Patient 12 never had seizures. No epileptiform discharge localization was observed. Mild background slowing was present with a PDR of 11 Hertz. Anterior/Posterior gradient was present.\n",

chronic elevations were not noted in any patient., Patients with autosomal recessive mutations in ERLIN2 present profound intellectual disability, developmental regression and multiple contractures., Despite the severity of the intellectual disability and neuromuscular findings, the results of brain imaging, electromyography and muscle biopsy appeared normal in these patients., A family was found to have a homozygous null mutation in ERLIN2, with affected individuals presenting with a hereditary spastic paraplegia phenotype., Three patients showed accumulation of an amorphous substance in the liver, which is supportive of the role of NGLY1 and may help explain the liver disease noted in these patients., The undefined stored substance likely represents accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins in the cytoplasm that have been retrotranslocated from the ER but cannot undergo further processing., Two other patients showed vacuolization consistent with storage., Transferrin isoelectric focusing or mass spectrometry studies in NGLY1-deficient patients have been normal or only subtly abnormal., Patients have axonal loss and gliosis in the brains suggestive of HIE, indicating that NGLY1 plays a role in maintaining central nervous system integrity., They also seem to have peripheral neuropathy that is relatively common in NGLY1 deficiency., Further studies are needed to determine the underlying pathogenesis of both central and peripheral nervous system abnormalities found in these patients., NGLY1 deficiency is characterized by a constellation of unique features including elevation of AFP and liver enzymes in infancy with relative normalization in early childhood, accumulation of a substance with staining properties similar to glycogen in hepatocyte cytoplasm, absent tears resulting in blepharitis and corneal ulceration, a movement disorder and peripheral neuropathy., The transient nature of the AFP and liver transaminase elevation may make older or more mildly affected individuals difficult to detect.]</td>\n",

chronic elevations were not noted in any patient., Patients with autosomal recessive mutations in ERLIN2 present profound intellectual disability, developmental regression and multiple contractures., Despite the severity of the intellectual disability and neuromuscular findings, the results of brain imaging, electromyography and muscle biopsy appeared normal in these patients., A family was found to have a homozygous null mutation in ERLIN2, with affected individuals presenting with a hereditary spastic paraplegia phenotype., Three patients showed accumulation of an amorphous substance in the liver, which is supportive of the role of NGLY1 and may help explain the liver disease noted in these patients., The undefined stored substance likely represents accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins in the cytoplasm that have been retrotranslocated from the ER but cannot undergo further processing., Two other patients showed vacuolization consistent with storage., Transferrin isoelectric focusing or mass spectrometry studies in NGLY1-deficient patients have been normal or only subtly abnormal., Patients have axonal loss and gliosis in the brains suggestive of HIE, indicating that NGLY1 plays a role in maintaining central nervous system integrity., They also seem to have peripheral neuropathy that is relatively common in NGLY1 deficiency., Further studies are needed to determine the underlying pathogenesis of both central and peripheral nervous system abnormalities found in these patients., NGLY1 deficiency is characterized by a constellation of unique features including elevation of AFP and liver enzymes in infancy with relative normalization in early childhood, accumulation of a substance with staining properties similar to glycogen in hepatocyte cytoplasm, absent tears resulting in blepharitis and corneal ulceration, a movement disorder and peripheral neuropathy., The transient nature of the AFP and liver transaminase elevation may make older or more mildly affected individuals difficult to detect.]   \n",

There were no age or genotype differences between individuals having seizures and those without. In fact, in each sibling pair, one had seizures and the other did not.\n",

Delayed myelination was present in three of the four youngest individuals, but all the older individuals had complete myelination. Six of nine individuals had qualitatively-evident cerebral atrophy that ranged from slight to moderate. Four individuals (#1, #2, #6, #10) also had slight cerebellar atrophy. The atrophy tended to be greater in the older individuals (p=0.17, Supplementary Figure S3), and in one teenager (#11) follow-up imaging showed atrophy measurably worse after a 20-month interval (net loss of 34 cm3 relative to expected). Increased atrophy correlated with worsening of all functional measurements (Supplementary Figure S3), including IQ or DQ (p<0.03), Vineland assessments (p<0.03), and Nijmegen scores (p=0.01). Brain volume also directly correlated with CSF levels of 5-HIAA (p=0.03), tetrahydrobiopterin (p=0.02), and 5-HVA (p=0.06) (Supplementary Figure S3).\n",

At four months of age, hypotonia, developmental delay and elevated liver transaminases were noted. At approximately 4 years of age, a slight intention tremor and frequent involuntary movements of her neck, hands and arm were observed. At 5 years of age, she was noted to have ocular apraxia, distal tapering of hands and feet, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. She has cortical vision impairment, as well as alacrima and dry eyes that require lubrication, but has not developed corneal scarring. Presently, she has marked intellectual disabilities and requires total care. She has very little expressive speech and communicates through an electronic speech-generating device. She continues to ambulate with a walker.\n",

      "Patient 2, a now 20-year-old female, was born at 39 weeks of gestation via Cesarean section because of intrauterine growth retardation and an abnormal appearing placenta. At four months of age, hypotonia, developmental delay and elevated liver transaminases were noted. At approximately 4 years of age, a slight intention tremor and frequent involuntary movements of her neck, hands and arm were observed. At 5 years of age, she was noted to have ocular apraxia, distal tapering of hands and feet, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. She has cortical vision impairment, as well as alacrima and dry eyes that require lubrication, but has not developed corneal scarring. Presently, she has marked intellectual disabilities and requires total care. She has very little expressive speech and communicates through an electronic speech-generating device. She continues to ambulate with a walker.\n",

      "  - `patient_id`: Identifying information for the patient within the context of the article\n",
      "    - When a single patient is unambiguously referenced by an identifier, this must be equal to that identifier; typically an integer or anonymized name like \"Patient 1\" or other arbitrary string \n",
      "    - When ALL patients are referenced without individual attribution (i.e. a specific `patient_id` is not clear), use the value \"ALL\" for this field\n",
      "    - When SOME patients are referenced without individual attribution (i.e. a specific `patient_id` is not clear), use the value \"SOME\" for this field\n",
      "  - `external_study`: If context implies that the patient being referenced is from another study, include any identifying information for that study/reference in this field (e.g. citation numbers or author names); if no such distinction is made, assume it is from the current study and report only the value \"NA\"\n",
